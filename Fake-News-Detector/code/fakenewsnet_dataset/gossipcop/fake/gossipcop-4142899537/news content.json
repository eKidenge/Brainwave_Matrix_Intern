His very own little surfer dude!\u201d says a source. \u201cThey feel very blessed. It\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple was engaged in 2012, split a year later, only to reunite in Australia\u2019s Byron Bay over the recent summer holidays.\n\nEither way, the couple\u2019s behaviour since the shock reunion has certainly been interesting.\n\nThey\u2019ve sort of moved back in together \u2013 Miley purchased a house just metres from Liam\u2019s property in Malibu, California.\n\nThere appears to be a private lane connecting the two homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading the player...\n\nMiley has also continued to share images of herself on social media smoking what appears to be marijuana. But eagle-eyed fans were quick to point out to NW that they suspect the shots are old as Miley isn\u2019t wearing her engagement ring, which has been back on her finger for two months.\n\nWhether or not the rumours are true, there\u2019s no denying the pair would make adorable parents.\n\nMiley has long proved her maternal instinct by adopting a menagerie of rescue animals, while 26-year-old Liam is besotted with his brothers Chris and Luke\u2019s children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love my brothers\u2019 kids. It\u2019s funny. As an uncle, you become so protective of them,\u201d Liam \u2013 who even lets niece India paint his toenails! \u2013 admits.\n\n\u201cWhen I go away and I shoot something, I constantly want to see photos of them. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nMiley with her fur babies.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Sign up to receive the Woman's Day e-Newsletter and offers we choose to share with you straight to your
