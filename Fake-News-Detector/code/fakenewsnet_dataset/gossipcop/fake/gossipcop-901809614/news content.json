He went out with his single friends and sometimes would have very little contact with Jen for days,\" the source revealed.\n\n02 of 10 THEY WANTED TO HAVE KIDS EARLY ON IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP Kevin Mazur/WireImage When Aniston and Theroux got engaged in 2012, they hoped their happily ever after included starting a family together. \"When Jen met Justin, she had almost given up on the idea that she would have kids,\u201d a source close to Aniston told PEOPLE. \u201cThey wanted to have a baby, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d While the pair were disappointed kids didn\u2019t come into their lives, they didn\u2019t let it devastate them. \u201cShe has been sad that it never happened,\u201d the source said, \u201cbut it never consumed her.\u201d\n\n03 of 10 JENNIFER STILL BELIEVES IN LOVE Rob Latour/Variety/Shutterstock Aniston is \u201csad and disappointed\u201d that her marriage to Theroux didn\u2019t work out, a source close to the actress told PEOPLE. \u201cShe didn\u2019t expect to be single again.\u201d As for her future, \u201cshe isn\u2019t a fan of dating, and she never was. She always found dating awkward and unpleasant,\u201d an Aniston source explained. \u201cShe hates all the media attention that she knows she will get now. But she is a big believer in falling in love and spending her life with a partner that loves sharing hers.\u201d\n\n04 of 10 SHE WILL MOST LIKELY KEEP THE RING James Devaney/WireImage; Inset: James Devaney/WireImage In the wake of the news of the pair's separation after two and a half years of marriage, the former couple now face the unpleasant task of having to divide their assets and shared property. But what about Aniston's huge diamond engagement ring? \u201cThe engagement ring pre-dates the marriage, and therefore is Jennifer\u2019s separate property regardless of whether it is mentioned in the prenuptial agreement,\u201d L.A.-based attorney and certified family law specialist David Glass, who\u2019s not involved with Aniston and Theroux\u2019s split, shared with PEOPLE. \u201cAs long as the parties get married, then the recipient keeps the engagement ring.\u201d\n\n05 of 10 THEY HAD 'ISSUES' BEFORE EVEN TYING THE KNOT Christopher Polk/Getty The couple was plagued by problems in their relationship well before they tied the knot \u2014 some of the same issues that ultimately led to their marriage\u2019s demise, an insider told PEOPLE. The source close to the pair shared that Aniston and Theroux each preferred different coasts, a major source of continued discord for the pair. \"Ever since they became serious, the living issue often made them bicker. It was always hard for Jen to understand why Justin didn\u2019t like, or at least could learn to like L.A., when she was in L.A.,\u201d the source shared. For a long time, the couple accommodated each other, with Theroux spending more and more time on his own in New York City. \u201cWith Jen feeling so strongly about living in L.A. and disliking N.Y.C. so much, she wanted Justin to be happy and that\u2019s why she agreed that he should spend so much time in N.Y.C.,\u201d said the insider.\n\n06 of 10 THEY SAW EACH OTHER 'ONE LAST TIME' ON VALENTINE'S DAY Joe Schildhorn/BFA.com/REX/Shutterstock The couple last met up on the most romantic holiday of the year, one day before publicly announcing that they had split. \u201cThey saw each other late at night on Valentine\u2019s Day in L.A.,\u201d a source close to the actress told PEOPLE. \u201cThey decided together that they would make the announcement the next day. Justin flew on a private jet to L.A. to see Jen one last time.\u201d The insider added that the pair was divided on when to announce the breakup news, with the Friends star hoping to continue to keep the matter private. \"Jen didn\u2019t want to announce it for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention,\u201d the source says. \u201cJen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren\u2019t wondering why he wasn\u2019t with her. But that\u2019s not Justin\u2019s style,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cHe wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.\u201d\n\n07 of 10 A BRAD & JENNIFER REUNION IS UNLIKELY Karwai Tang/Getty; Tim P. Whitby/Getty The internet went into a frenzy with the possibility of Aniston and ex-husband Brad Pitt rekindling a romantic relationship. But a source told PEOPLE a reconciliation between the former couple seems highly unlikely. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen each other in ages,\u201d said a source with knowledge of Pitt and Aniston's current relationship. \u201cFor well over a decade now they have lived totally separate lives and so not surprisingly, they have become totally different people than who they once were when they were together.\u201d Despite the constant tabloid chatter over the years suggesting they never stopped loving each other, both Aniston and Pitt have completely moved on. \"They\u2019ve been over each other for longer than they were ever together,\u201d said the source. \u201cIt is such ancient history.\u201d\n\n08 of 10 '[THEY] STILL TALK ALL THE TIME' Patrick Lewis/StarPix/REX/Shutterstock Despite calling it quits, the former couple still keep in touch. \"Justin and Jen still talk all the time,\u201d a source told PEOPLE of the former couple. With the pair announcing their separation several weeks after splitting at the beginning of the year, \u201cshe\u2019s in an okay place as she was in control of the situation,\u201d added the source.\n\n09 of 10 JENNIFER'S LIFE HASN'T CHANGED MUCH SINCE THE SPLIT Billy Farrell/BFA/Shutterstock \"Since her split from Justin, Jen is doing fine,\" a source told PEOPLE in March 2018. The duo has \"had some contact\" after the breakup but \"won\u2019t get back together,\" added the source. \"Justin has moved on with his life in N.Y.C.,\u201d while \u201cJen still enjoys hers in L.A.,\" the source continued. Ultimately, Aniston\u2019s \u201clife now is not very different\u201d than it was before the breakup, the source said. \u201cShe loves socializing with friends.\u201d", "images":
