James Corden, Idris Elba, Oprah and George Clooney were also in attendance, among hundreds of stars.\n\nAngelina Jolie however, did not attend the nuptials on 19 May.\n\nThere\u2019s a rumour going around about why the actress decided the wedding wasn\u2019t for her, and it\u2019s got to do with her children.\n\nAccording to a \u2018source\u2019 who spoke to Star Magazine, Jolie had been invited to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s wedding, but refused to go because her children weren\u2019t invited.\n\nThe source allegedly told the magazine: \u2018She was insulted that her kids weren\u2019t invited. She was allowed to bring one guest \u2013 more than most people got, actually \u2013 but didn\u2019t have a date to take.\n\n\u2018In the end, she decided to skip it altogether\u2019.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\nAccording to People, the director was seen landing in London with her kids two days prior to the wedding \u2013 but she was in England\u2019s capital for work, not play.\n\nMaleficent 2, for which she will be reprising her role as the wicked witch, began filming in the UK.\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your first look at Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning as Maleficent and Aurora on the set of #Maleficent2. pic.twitter.com/4WEevU1Lis \u2014 Disney (@Disney) May 29, 2018\n\nMetro has contacted Angelina Jolie\u2019s representative for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
