{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry", "text": "American singer (born 1984)\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. Perry is one of the best-selling music artists in history, having sold over 143 million units worldwide. She is known for her influence on pop music and her camp style, being dubbed the \"Queen of Camp\" by Vogue and Rolling Stone.\n\nAt 16, Perry released a gospel record titled Katy Hudson (2001) under Red Hill Records, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles at 17 to venture into secular music, and later adopted the stage name \"Katy Perry\" from her mother's maiden name. She recorded an album while signed to Columbia Records, but was dropped before signing to Capitol Records. Perry rose to fame with One of the Boys (2008), a pop rock record containing her debut single \"I Kissed a Girl\" and follow-up single \"Hot n Cold\", which reached number one and three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 respectively.\n\nThe disco-influenced pop album Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five U.S. number one singles\u2014\"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\"\u2014 the only album by a female singer to do so. The album's reissue titled Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection (2012) produced the U.S. number one single \"Part of Me\". Her empowerment-themed album Prism (2013) had two U.S. number one singles, \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". Both their respective music videos made her the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo and YouTube. Afterwards, Perry released the albums Witness (2017) and Smile (2020) and embarked on her Las Vegas concert residency titled Play (2021\u20132023). She released her seventh studio album, titled 143, in 2024.\n\nPerry has the second-most U.S. Diamond-certified singles for any female artist (six). She has received various accolades, including a Billboard Spotlight Award, four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, a Juno Award, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. Outside of music, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, voiced Smurfette in The Smurfs film series (2011\u20132013), and launched her own shoe line Katy Perry Collections in 2017. Perry served as a judge on American Idol from the sixteenth season in 2018 to the twenty-second season in 2024. Forbes ranked her as the world's highest-paid female musician in 2015 and 2018. With an estimated net worth of $350 million, she is one of the world's wealthiest musicians. Billboard ranked her fourth on its \"Greatest of All Time Pop Songs Artists\" list and twenty-fifth on their \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" list.\n\nLife and career\n\n1984\u20131999: Early life and family\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (n\u00e9e Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson.[2] Both of her parents turned to religion after a \"wild youth\".[3] Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry.[4] Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry.[5] She has a younger brother named David, who is also a singer,[6] and an older sister, Angela.[7]\n\nFrom ages three to 11, Perry frequently moved across the country as her very strict parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years.[2][8] The family struggled financially,[9] sometimes using food stamps and eating food from the food bank which also fed the congregation at her parents' church.[10]\n\nGrowing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word \"luck\" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and were also required to call deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\".[11] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[12] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she smuggled home from her friends.[13] Perry later recalled a story about how a friend of hers played \"You Oughta Know\" by Alanis Morissette, which influenced her songwriting and singing.\n\nWhile not strictly identifying as religious, she has stated, \"I pray all the time \u2013 for self-control, for humility.\"[15] Wanting to be like her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of her parents, who let her take vocal lessons like Angela was doing at the time. She began training at age nine[16] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry,[3] singing in church from ages nine to 17.[17] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday,[3][18] and publicly performed songs she wrote.[9] She tried to \"be a bit like the typical Californian girl\" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Her brother David described her as a \"tomboy\" during her adolescence, which Perry talks about on her song \"One of the Boys\".[19] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[20] Perry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements early at age 15,[21] during her first year of high school,[22] and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a music career.[23]\n\n2000\u20132006: Career beginnings, Katy Hudson, and Fingerprints\n\nPerry briefly had vocal lessons with a woman named Agatha Danoff[24] in facilities rented from the Music Academy of the West.[25] Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills.[23] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar.[12] Perry signed with Red Hill Records and recorded her debut album, a contemporary Christian record titled Katy Hudson, which was released on March 6, 2001. She also went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour[26][27] and embarked on other performances of her own in the United States.[28] Katy Hudson received mixed reviews from critics and was commercially unsuccessful, selling an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December.[29][30] Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started working with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at the age of 17.[32] She opted to work with Ballard due to his past work with Alanis Morissette, one of her major inspirations. In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry, to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson, and later adopted the stage name \"Katy Perry\", using her mother's maiden name. In 2010, she recalled that \"Thinking of You\" was one of the first songs she wrote after moving to Los Angeles.[34] Perry would also perform at the Hotel Caf\u00e9, performing new music while she was between record labels.[35]\n\nIn 2004, she signed to Ballard's label, Java Records, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. Perry began work on a solo record due for release in March 2005, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped.[36] Ballard then introduced her to Tim Devine, an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. By November 2006, Perry had finished writing and recording material for her Columbia debut titled Fingerprints (with some of the material from this time appearing on One of the Boys) which was planned for release in 2007.[37] Some of the material from Fingerprints that did not make it on One of the Boys was given to other artists, such as \"I Do Not Hook Up\" and \"Long Shot\" to Kelly Clarkson, and \"Rock God\" to Selena Gomez & the Scene.[38][39]\n\nPerry worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, the Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke.[40][41] In addition, after Devine suggested that songwriting team the Matrix become a \"real group\", she recorded an album, The Matrix, with them.[42] The Matrix was planned for release in 2004 but was cancelled due to creative differences. It was released in 2009 after the release of One of the Boys. Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as Fingerprints neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&R company, Taxi Music.[43]\n\nPerry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, \"Simple\", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[44] Perry provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\",[45] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie.[46] In September 2004, Blender named her \"The Next Big Thing\".[44] She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single \"Goodbye for Now\", was featured at the end of its music video in 2006, and performed it with them on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.[47] That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for \"Learn to Fly\" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for \"Cupid's Chokehold\".[48]\n\n2007\u20132009: Breakthrough with One of the Boys\n\nAfter Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke to add an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material.[49][50] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to \"Ur So Gay\", a song aimed at introducing her to the music market.[51] A digital EP of the same name was also released that month.[52] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising it on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008,[53] stating \"Ur So Gay\" was her \"favorite song\" at the time.[54] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode \"Life's Too Short\"[55] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot that June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.[56]\n\nPerry was part of the 2008 Warped Tour lineup.\n\nPerry released her first single with Capitol, \"I Kissed a Girl\", on April 28, 2008,[57] as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it.[58] The track reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[59] \"I Kissed a Girl\" created controversy among both religious and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual theme, while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success.[60] One of the Boys, released on June 17, 2008, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the US Billboard 200.[61][62] The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide.[63] \"Hot n Cold\" was released the following September[64] and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100[65] while topping charts in Germany,[66] Canada,[67] the Netherlands[68] and Austria.[69] Later singles \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas\" were released in 2009[70][71] and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.[65] The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.[46][72]\n\nAfter finishing the 2008 Warped Tour,[73] Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where she won the award for Best New Act.[74] At the 2009 Brit Awards, she also won the award for International Female Solo Artist.[75] Perry embarked on her first headlining world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys.[76] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of No Doubt's 2009 Summer Tour.[77] Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies of the European awards.[78] On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys as well as one new song, \"Brick by Brick\", and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's \"Hackensack\".[79] It was released on November 17, 2009.[80] Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song \"Starstrukk\" in September 2009,[81] and on a duet with Timbaland entitled \"If We Ever Meet Again\", from his album Shock Value II, three months later.[82][83] The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the \"Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist\", for digital single sales of over two million copies.[84]\n\nAfter Perry and Travie McCoy split up in December 2008,[85] they briefly reconciled before she ended their relationship in 2009.[86][87] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in mid-2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film.[88] She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[89] The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[90]\n\n2010\u20132012: Teenage Dream and marriage\n\nAfter serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[91] Perry released \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010.[92] The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June.[93] She also served as a guest judge on British The X Factor later that month[94] before releasing the album's second single, \"Teenage Dream\", in July.[95] \"Teenage Dream\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September.[96] Released on August 24, 2010,[97] Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,[98] and received mixed reviews from music critics.[99] It has since sold 6 million copies worldwide.[100] Teenage Dream would go on to win the 2011 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[101] In October, \"Firework\" was released as the album's third single.[102] It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.[103]\n\n\"E.T.\" featuring Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011.[104] It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the chart.[105] \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" followed as the fifth single in June,[106] and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[107] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011[108] and a 2013 Guinness World Record.[109] On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100.[110] After \"The One That Got Away\" was released as the album's sixth single in October, Teenage Dream became the third album to spawn six top-five songs on the Billboard Hot 100 after Rhythm Nation 1814 by Janet Jackson and Faith by George Michael.[111][112] The song peaked at number three in the US[113] and number two in Canada.[67]\n\nOn January 5, 2012, Perry was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[114] That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units when \"E.T.\" reached that mark along with \"Firework\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Hot N Cold\".[115] On February 13, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, \"Part of Me\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[116] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23,[117] and serves as a reissue of Teenage Dream.[118] \"Wide Awake\" was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single,[119] peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100[113] and number one in Canada[67] and New Zealand.[120]\n\nPerry attending the Sydney premiere for her 2012 documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me, which grossed $32.7 million\n\nPerry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream[76] from February 2011 to January 2012.[121] The tour grossed $59.5 million globally[122] and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards.[123] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna.[124] In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. Four days before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online.[125] Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.[126]\n\nIn December 2010, Perry played Moe Szyslak's girlfriend in the live-action segment from a Christmas episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Fight Before Christmas\".[127][128] In February 2011, she made a guest appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Oh Honey\", playing a woman known as Honey.[129] The role won her the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Guest Star in January 2012.[130] She made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette on July 29, 2011.

NBC also felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes.[203] The song reached number one in Australia[204] and number eleven in the United States.[65]\n\nPerry performing during Witness: The Tour in October 2017\n\nIn August 2016, Perry stated that she aspired to create material \"that connects and relates and inspires\"[205] and told Ryan Seacrest that she was \"not rushing\" her fifth album, adding \"I'm just having a lot of fun, but experimenting and trying different producers, and different collaborators, and different styles\".[206] On February 10, 2017, Perry released the album's lead single \"Chained to the Rhythm\" featuring Skip Marley.[207][208] It reached number one in Hungary[209] and number four in the United States.[65] The track was also streamed over three million times on Spotify within 24 hours, breaking the music streaming service's record at the time for the highest first-day streaming for a single track by a female artist.[210] The album's second single, \"Bon App\u00e9tit\" with Migos, was released that April.[211] Its third single, \"Swish Swish\", featured Nicki Minaj and followed the next month.[212] They respectively peaked at numbers 59 and 46 in the United States,[65] and made the top 15 in Canada.[67]\n\nThe album, titled Witness, was released on June 9, 2017, to mixed reviews,[213] and debuted at number one in the United States.[214] To accompany the album's release, Perry broadcast herself on YouTube for four days with a live-stream titled Katy Perry Live: Witness World Wide, concluding with a live concert on June 12.[215] The live-stream generated over 49 million views from 190 countries.[216] She also embarked on Witness: The Tour, which began in September 2017 and ended in August 2018.[217] On June 15, 2017, Calvin Harris released a song titled \"Feels\" from his album Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1, which featured Perry, Big Sean, and Pharrell Williams.[218] The song went on to reach number one in the United Kingdom.[219]\n\nPerry subsequently recorded a cover of the Dear Evan Hansen song \"Waving Through a Window\" for the deluxe edition of the cast recording, which was released on November 2, 2018.[220] The show's creators Benj Pasek and Justin Paul had requested Perry to cover the song to promote the musical's national tour.[221] Later that month, Perry released \"Cozy Little Christmas\".[222] She also recorded the song \"Immortal Flame\" for the game Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, and had a playable character modeled after her.[223]\n\nOutside of recording music, Perry appeared as herself in the film Zoolander 2, which was released in February 2016.[224][225] In February 2017, the singer launched a shoe line titled \"Katy Perry Collections\".[226] Her shoes are available on her website, Katy Perry Collections, and at retailers such as Dillard's and Walmart.[227] The following August, she hosted the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[228] Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on the sixteenth season of American Idol, which premiered in March 2018.[229][230] Perry began a relationship with Orlando Bloom in early 2016, and the couple got engaged on February 14, 2019.[231][232]\n\n2019\u20132020: Smile and motherhood\n\nPerry at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards\n\nAt the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Perry performed \"Here You Come Again\", alongside Dolly Parton and Kacey Musgraves, as part of a tribute to Parton.[233] Four days later, she released a song called \"365\", with DJ Zedd.[234] In April, Perry was included on a remix of Daddy Yankee's song \"Con Calma\", featuring Snow.[235] She followed this with the singles \"Never Really Over\" on May 31, \"Small Talk\" on August 9, and \"Harleys in Hawaii\" on October 16.[236][237][238] \"Never Really Over\" in particular received critical acclaim.[239]\n\nIn June 2019, Perry appeared in the music video of Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\".[240] In July, a jury in California returned a verdict following a week-long trial that Perry's song \"Dark Horse\" had copied Flame's 2008 song \"Joyful Noise\" after he filed a copyright lawsuit alleging that it used his track's beat without permission;[241] the verdict was later overturned.[242] After the initial verdict, the jury ordered her to pay him $550,000.[243] The next month, Josh Kloss, Perry's co-star in the \"Teenage Dream\" music video, accused her of sexual misconduct.[244] In an Instagram post, Kloss alleged that, during a party at a skating rink, Perry pulled on his sweatpants and underwear, exposing his penis to her male friends. He also said her management prevented him from speaking about his time with the singer. Johnny Wujek, the creative director of said party defended Perry, saying that she \"would never do something like that\" and accused Kloss of having an \"ongoing obsession\" with her.[245] After initially refraining from responding to this, believing it would have detracted from the Me Too movement, Perry has also denied Kloss's claims.[246]\n\nFollowing the release of her single \"Never Worn White\" in March 2020, Perry revealed in the accompanying music video that she was expecting her first child with Bloom.[247] \"Daisies\", the lead single from her sixth album, was released on May 15, 2020.

She described it as \"larger than life\" and \"the kookiest, most camp show I've ever put together.\"[265] The show has received critical acclaim[268] with Melinda Sheckells of Billboard saying that Play's \"sold-out opening night is part fantasy, part hallucination and thoroughly camp.[269] In addition to a sold out opening night, the Santa Barbara Independent reported that Perry's contract deal for the residency was worth $168 million.[270] It concluded on November 4, 2023,[271] and grossed $46.4 million.[272]\n\nIn September 2021, Variety paid tribute to and honored Perry in their \"Power of Women\" issue, where she discussed her career, motherhood, and philanthropy.[273] As a nominee, she attended the Variety 2021 \"Power of Women\" dinner.[274] On her 37th birthday the next month, Perry guest hosted The Ellen DeGeneres Show[275] and starred in a holiday advertisement for Gap Inc. which featured her singing \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles.

On the collab, she stated in August 2022: \"'Harleys in Hawaii' has lived so many different lives\" as well as that there was \"so much opportunity to remix this song, and I can't wait to hear all the GarageBand evolutions with this Apple collab.\"[287] Perry performed at the May 2023 Coronation Concert of Charles III at Windsor Castle.[288][289] Four months later, she sold her music rights to Litmus Music for an estimated $225 million.[290]\n\n2024: 143\n\nDuring an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in February 2024, Perry announced her exit from American Idol following the conclusion of the twenty-second season, saying she wanted to \"go out and feel that pulse to my own beat\" and release new music after being \"in the studio for a while\". The season premiered later that month,[291] and concluded in May.[292] She released \"Woman's World\", the first single from her seventh album, on July 11, 2024.[293] Two other singles preceded the record's release: \"Lifetimes\"[294][295] and \"I'm His, He's Mine\" featuring Doechii.[296]\n\nThe album, titled 143, was released on September 20.[297] She described it as \"super high energy, it's super summer, it's very high BPM\" and \"just full of so much joy, so much love, so much light\".[298] The record was panned by critics, and Perry was widely criticized for her decision to work with Dr. Luke on it after singer Kesha's allegations of sexual assault against him.[299][300] On September 11, Perry received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards.[301] She performed during the 2024 Rock in Rio festival on the day of 143's release.[302] Eight days later, Perry headlined the pre-game entertainment at Australia's 2024 AFL Grand Final.[303] That December, she will film a performance at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster for a special titled Katy Perry: Night of a Lifetime, which is set to premiere on ITV, ITV1, STV, and STV Player.[304]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nPerry cites her sister Angela as the woman who has had the most influence on her.[273] During the early stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as successful as Amy Grant.[305] At age 15, she heard \"Killer Queen\" by Queen, which inspired her to pursue a music career.[306] She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the \"combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude\" inspired her music.[307] She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen.[194] Perry described the Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: \"Pet Sounds is one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds.\"[308] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as \"the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.\"[309]\n\nShe cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, stating in 2012: \"Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless.\" Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[310] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying \"I want to evolve like Madonna\".[311]\n\nPerry names Bj\u00f6rk as an influence, particularly admiring her \"willingness to always be taking chances\".[310] Other artists who Perry has cited as influences include Stevie Nicks,[312] ABBA, the Cardigans,[313] Whitney Houston,[314] Cyndi Lauper,[315] Ace of Base, 3OH!3,[316] CeCe Peniston, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, Crystal Waters, Mariah Carey,[317] Heart, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Imogen Heap, Rufus Wainwright,[318] Pink,[319] and Gwen Stefani.[310] \"Firework\" was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people watch in awe.[320] Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.[321] She also credits the 1996 film The Craft for inspiring her song \"Dark Horse\",[322] and Eckhart Tolle's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism.[150]\n\nMusical style and themes\n\nWhen I am in between records, sometimes I doubt myself. I'll be like \"Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?\" And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes. \u2014Perry on her confidence as a songwriter [ 323 ]\n\nAlthough Perry's music incorporates elements of pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences.[324][325] Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life.[326] Her fifth studio effort Witness is an electropop album that she described as a \"360-degree liberation\" record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity.[327][328] Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W magazine described the album's sexual innuendos as \"irresistible hook-laden melodies\".[32] Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.[329]\n\nPerry has described herself as a \"singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star\"[330] and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: \"I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable.\"[15] Actress and comedian Kristen Wiig commented that \"as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record.\"[309] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, \"being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.\"[331] In 2013, The New York Times labeled her \"the most potent pop star of the day \u2013 her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation\".[332] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent \"clich\u00e9s\".[333] Throughout her career, Perry has also co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Lesley Roy,[334] Kelly Clarkson,[335] Jessie James Decker,[336] Selena Gomez & the Scene,[337][338] Britney Spears,[339] Iggy Azalea, Rita Ora,[340] Nicki Minaj, and Ariana Grande.[341]\n\nVoice\n\nPerry has a contralto vocal range.[342][343] Her singing has received both praise and criticism. Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her \"powerful voice is hard-edged\"[344] while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as \"processed staccato blips\".[325] Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a \"perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable\".[345] Alex Miller from NME felt that \"Perry's problem is often her voice\" on One of the Boys, stating that \"somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick\".[346] Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her \"rock chick voice\" in a review of a concert promoting Prism.[347]\n\nPublic image\n\nPerry in her signature spinning peppermint swirl dress at the California Dreams Tour (2011)\n\nOn social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in November 2013.[348] She won the 2015 Guinness World Record for most Twitter followers,[349] and became the first person to gain 100 million followers on the site in June 2017.[350] Keith Caulfield of Billboard stated that Perry is \"the rare celebrity who seems to have enormous popularity but genuine ground-level interaction with her adoring KatyCats\".[351] With over 105 million Twitter followers, she is the second-most followed woman on the site, and the sixth most followed musician across social media with a combined total of over 382 million followers across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.[352] In June 2017, Time magazine listed Perry among its \"25 Most Influential People on the Internet\" of the year, writing that her live-stream for Witness was \"blazing a trail\" for being \"the closest any major entertainer has come to giving fans the kind of 'real' intimacy that social media purports to provide\".[353]\n\nPerry has been described as a sex symbol; GQ labeled her a \"full-on male fantasy\",[9] while Elle wrote her body looked \"as though sketched by a teenage boy\".[22] Vice called her a \"'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol\".[354] She was placed at number one on the Maxim Hot 100 in 2010 as the \"most beautiful woman in the world\", with editor Joe Levy describing her as a \"triple \u2013 no quadruple \u2013 kind of hot\".[355] Men's Health readers voted her the \"sexiest woman of 2013\".[356] In November 2010, Perry told Harper's Bazaar that she was proud of and satisfied with her figure.[357]\n\nPerry's fashion often incorporates humor, bright colors, and food-related themes[358] such as her characteristic spinning peppermint swirl dress.[359] Vogue described her as \"never exactly one to shy away from the outrageous or the extreme in any realm\", and called her the \"Queen of Camp\",[360][361] while Glamour named her the \"queen of quirk\".[362] In February 2009, Perry told Seventeen that her fashion style was \"a bit of a concoction of different things\" and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing.[363] She has also described herself as having \"multipersonality disorder\" for fashion.[357] Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Daphne Guinness, Natalie Portman, and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons.[32][364] In 2022, Elle dubbed her as \"the kitsch-loving pop star renowned for her uniquely experimental style\", while Vogue described her style as \"synonymous with outrageous, eye-catching ensembles that lean towards the theatrical\".[365][366]\n\nDuring the 2017 launch of her shoe collection, Katy Perry Collections, she said about shoes: \"When I first got to L.A., I cultivated my style on a budget, always shopping at thrift stores or vintage stores. ... Once, I found these flats that looked like Dalmatian dogs. They had ears that moved and a tongue that stuck out. They were such a conversation piece. That's what is so great about fashion. ... It's a form of communication. You don't have to start a smoking habit to start talking to someone. You can just wear cool shoes. It's an icebreaker.\"[367]\n\nLegacy\n\nSeveral media outlets such as Billboard and Glamour have referred to her as the \"Queen of Pop\", while others like Vogue, Rolling Stone, and InStyle have dubbed Perry the \"Queen of Camp\".[375] Andrew Unterberger of Billboard described Teenage Dream \"one of the defining LPs from a new golden age in mega-pop\"[376] while Christopher Rosa of Glamour named her as an influence to the pop sound and style of the 2010s, adding that her singles are \"some of the most recognizable, iconic, and impactful hits in pop history.\"[377] Perry was named \"one of the last decade's most reliable and successful hitmakers\" by the Official Charts Company in 2022.[378]\n\nAdditionally, Perry was included in Glamour's \"104 Women Who Defined the Decade in Pop Culture\" list of the 2010s. It stated Perry \"did more than just break chart records. She was one of the driving forces behind the sound of pop radio in the 2010s\" for her tracks that were \"glossy, booming, sugary-sweet, and undeniably catchy.\"[377][379] Variety included Perry in their Variety 500 list of the most influential business leaders, calling her a \"global phenomenon\" and a \"dedicated artist and tireless self-promoter who has leveraged chart-topping hits, sold-out stadium shows, and staggering endorsement deals to become one of the richest and most influential pop stars alive.\"[380] A 2017 journal published by Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts studying structural patterns in the melodies of earworm songs compiled lists of catchiest tracks from 3,000 participants, in which Perry's \"California Gurls\" ranked number six. She has been called a \"gay icon\" by Taylor Henderson of Out, noting how \"I Kissed a Girl\" helped fans explore their sexuality and how Perry openly embraced the LGBTQ+ community.[265]\n\nPerry's music has been described by Out as having a \"lasting legacy\", with American singers Fletcher sampling \"I Kissed a Girl\" and Olivia Rodrigo referencing Teenage Dream on \"Brutal\".[265] Additionally, other artists such as Halsey and Ariana Grande have praised Perry's work, with Halsey calling Teenage Dream the \"perfect pop album\" and Grande saying \"The One That Got Away\" is \"one of the biggest and most perfectly written pop songs ever from one of the best pop albums of all time.\"[382][383]\n\nOther ventures\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nPerry became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in December 2013.\n\nPerry has supported various charitable organizations and causes throughout her career.

And now that is my community.\" She also mentioned \"I wouldn't have survived without the community and it's amazing how full circle it's come and how much growth has happened since I started.\"[265] Tom\u00e1s Mier of Rolling Stone remarked Perry \"championed queer folks, especially drag queens, throughout her career.\"[370]\n\nShe dedicated the music video to her song \"Firework\" to the It Gets Better Project.[405] In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting \"hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [other] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future.\"[406] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth.[407]\n\nPerry identifies as a feminist,[408] and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aimed to spread female empowerment.[409] She has also said that America's lack of free health care drove her \"absolutely crazy\".[410] Following the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, Perry and nearly 200 other artists and executives in music signed an open letter organized by Billboard addressed to United States Congress demanding increased gun control in the United States.[411]\n\nThrough Twitter and by performing at rallies, Perry supported President Barack Obama in his run for re-election and praised his support for same-sex marriage[412] and LGBT equality.[413] She performed at three rallies for Obama, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin, singing a rendition of \"Let's Stay Together\" as well as a number of her songs. During her Las Vegas performance she wore a dress made to replicate a voting ballot, with Obama's box filled in.[414] On Twitter, she encouraged her followers to vote for Obama.[415]\n\nIn August 2013, Perry voiced criticism of Tony Abbott, then-leader of conservative Liberal Party of Australia and candidate for Prime Minister of Australia, due to his opposition to gay marriage and told Abbott, \"I love you as a human being but I can't give you my vote.\" The statement came after Abbott expressed pride at learning of Perry's then-upcoming performance in Australia.[416] In April 2014, she publicly supported Marianne Williamson in her campaign for California's 33rd congressional district by attending a political press event.[417] She endorsed Kamala Harris in the United States

Convention in support of Clinton.[422] Four years later, she supported Joe Biden and Kamala Harris during the 2020 United States presidential election, praising the latter as a leader who had \"experience we desperately need right now\" and believed that the former \"choosing her as his running mate is already a testament to his decision making\".[423] In 2022, Perry posted a picture of herself voting for conservative candidate Rick Caruso in the 2022 Los Angeles mayoral election, which Democrats heavily criticized her for.[424] During the 2024 United States presidential election, she endorsed Harris for office, stating \"I've always known her to fight for the most vulnerable, to speak up for the voiceless, and to protect our rights as women to make decisions about our own bodies\".[425]\n\nAchievements\n\nPerry at the ARIA Music Awards in November 2014\n\nThroughout her career, Perry has won five American Music Awards,[426] fourteen People's Choice Awards,[427] four
