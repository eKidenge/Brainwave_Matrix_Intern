You either believe \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 is an anthem that slays the history of music - or you think that Swifty needs to just not, tbh.\n\nAnd we know what you\u2019ve been wondering in the midst of this whole thing \u2013 where does Zayn Malik stand on the matter?\n\nLuckily, Zayn has confirmed once and for all whether he\u2019s a member of Team Tay or not, giving his say on all the backlash that Swifty has been facing over her shade-filled new track.\n\nChatting to The Fader who quizzed him on the Taylor Swift drama, Zayn kept things pretty neutral when he said: \"When it comes to anything that has to do with trivia about people\u2019s personal lives or things that\u2019s going on in their careers, I don\u2019t necessarily pay too much attention.\"\n\nKeeping well out of the whole thing, Zayn went on: \"I don\u2019t pay too much attention to what people even say about me. I just tend to take it for what it is when I meet them people in real life and have a conversation with them.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re cool with me, then I base my relationship on that.\"\n\nWhile Zayn is staying on the fence for theTaylor vs Kimye feud, he did go on to confirm that he has no issues with Swifty herself, who is of course best pals with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid.\n\n\"I rate her as an artist, I think she\u2019s cool, I think she\u2019s successful, and I think she deserves her success because she\u2019s worked hard,\" he said.\n\n\"That\u2019s just how I look at it. I did a song with her, it was fun, she was professional. She gets on with my girlfriend, they\u2019re good friends.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t have a bad word to say about her,\" Zayn added finally. \"She\u2019s cool.\"\n\nSo that's that, Mr Malik has spoken - and remained in Gigi's good boyfriend books as an extra bonus.\n\n'Words by Lucy Wood'", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:f5484d81-9e9b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:f24d3032-9e9b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:f37e7fc4-9e9b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:f4b29eca-9e9b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:21a558e9-9e7b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=webp&height=270&width=480&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:f5e2185f-9e9b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:21a558e9-9e7b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:f2e5eec1-9e9b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:21a558e9-9e7b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mtv.co.uk/news/z6a38w/zayn-malik-taylor-swift", "title": "Zayn Malik Has His Say On The Taylor Swift 'Look What You Made Me Do' Drama", "meta_data": {"app_version": "952ec94da8c1c2232cedb1eafc7b8a1101f6d790-20655-2024-12-17", "robots": "noydir,noodp, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "description": "\"That's just how I look at it...\"", "original-source": "https://www.mtv.co.uk/news/z6a38w/zayn-malik-taylor-swift", "search": {"title": "Zayn Malik Has His Say On The Taylor Swift 'Look What You Made Me Do' Drama", "description": "\"That's just how I look at it...\"", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:21a558e9-9e7b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "imageHeight": 540, "imageWidth": 960, "url": "/news/z6a38w/zayn-malik-taylor-swift", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-09-11T11:34:18.000Z"}, "og": {"site_name": "MTV", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:21a558e9-9e7b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "title": "Zayn Malik Has His Say On The Taylor Swift 'Look What You Made Me Do' Drama", "description": "\"That's just how I look at it...\"", "url": "https://www.mtv.co.uk/news/z6a38w/zayn-malik-taylor-swift", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"That's just how I look at it...\"", "title": "Zayn Malik Has His Say On The Taylor Swift 'Look What You Made Me Do' Drama", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:21a558e9-9e7b-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.co.uk", "summary": ""}
