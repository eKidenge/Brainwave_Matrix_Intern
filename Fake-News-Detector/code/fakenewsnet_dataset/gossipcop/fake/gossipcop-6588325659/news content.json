We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\nThey added, \u201cNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.
