Read our privacy policy\n\nPresident Donald Trump kicked boyband One Direction out of one of his hotels after they refused to meet his grown up daughter, it has been revealed.\n\nBand member Liam Payne let the news slip in a brand new interview with Rollacoaster.\n\nPayne stated that Trump had phoned their room asking if they'd be happy to meet either Ivanka or Tiffany - which daughter remains unclear - and their manager declined after refusing to wake them up.\n\nHe said: \u201cTrump actually kicked us out of his hotel once. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. It was about (meeting) his daughter. He phoned up our manager and we were asleep.\n\nTrump then proceeded to throw the entire band out of the hotel, and even refused to let them leave through a secret exit.\n\nPayne continued: \u201cHe said \u2018well, wake them up\u2019 and I was like \u2018no\u2019 and then he wouldn\u2019t let us use the underground garage. Obviously, in New York, we can\u2019t really go outside. New York is ruthless for us. So he was like, \u2018OK, then I don\u2019t want you in my hotel.\u2019 So we had to leave.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump apparently snubs handshake with Angela Merkel\n\nOne Direction are currently on an extended hiatus with each member currently enjoying solo careers; Payne's first record will be released later this year.\n\nPayne's fellow bandmate Niall Horan recently promised fans that the band would 'definitely' reunite one day in the future.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/static-assets/images/newsletters/nowHearThis1_1.png", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/donald-trump-one-direction-liam-payne-kicked-out-of-hotel-daughter-ivanka-tiffany-a7636451.html", "title": "Donald Trump kicked One Direction out of his hotel for refusing to meet his daughter", "meta_data": {"amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Donald Trump kicked One Direction out of his hotel for an unbelievable reason", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/donald-trump-one-direction-liam-payne-kicked-out-of-hotel-daughter-ivanka-tiffany-a7636451.html", "type": "article", "description": "The band were sleeping when the future president called the band's hotel room", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "description": "The band were sleeping when the future president called the band's hotel room", "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 311, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#f7f7f7", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "Donald Trump kicked One Direction out of his hotel for an unbelievable reason", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The band were sleeping when the future president called the band's hotel room", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump,One Direction,Liam Payne,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489857855.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
