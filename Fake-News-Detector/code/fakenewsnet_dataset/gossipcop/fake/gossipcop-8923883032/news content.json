Pitt has visitation rights.\n\nThe blog cited anonymous sources who portrayed ongoing talks between Pitt and Jolie as \"very amicable.\"\n\nThe two film actors met on the set of \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" in 2003, when Pitt was still married to actor Jennifer Aniston of \"Friends\" fame.\n\n\"Brangelina,\" as the couple is frequently named in celebrity media, got engaged in 2012, stating they did not plan to marry until same-sex marriage was legal across the United States.\n\nIn August 2014, 10 months before same-sex marriages were legal, they married in a surprise ceremony in France, where Jolie has family.\n\nJolie filed for divorce in September 2016, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nBrad's younger brother, Doug Pitt, is a Springfield-area entrepreneur who does philanthropic work with local charities such as Care to Learn and international ones such as WorldServe.\n\nRelated Pitt-Jolie news:\n\nBrad Pitt calls Springfield 'a big place now' in GQ interview\n\nBrad Pitt cleared of child abuse allegations\n\nNews-Leader asks Doug Pitt for reaction after Angelina Jolie splits with Brad Pitt", "images": ["http://www.news-leader.com/gcdn/-mm-/0347010ea20f1926b1814353071b1b499a6b43eb/c=0-176-1992-2168/local/-/media/2016/10/19/Springfield/Springfield/636124864992160313-Hernandez-GregPortrait-B.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "http://www.news-leader.com/gcdn/-mm-/27c299fb7acc0bb86690fcaeeda9822d69b99dbb/c=0-99-2993-1790/local/-/media/2017/05/03/Springfield/Springfield/636294151161868489-pittapril21017.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.news-leader.com/gcdn/-mm-/27c299fb7acc0bb86690fcaeeda9822d69b99dbb/c=0-99-2993-1790/local/-/media/2017/05/03/Springfield/Springfield/636294151161868489-pittapril21017.jpg?width=2993&height=1691&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "http://www.news-leader.com/gcdn/-mm-/27c299fb7acc0bb86690fcaeeda9822d69b99dbb/c=0-99-2993-1790/local/-/media/2017/05/03/Springfield/Springfield/636294151161868489-pittapril21017.jpg?width=660&height=371&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.news-leader.com/gcdn/-mm-/27c299fb7acc0bb86690fcaeeda9822d69b99dbb/c=0-99-2993-1790/local/-/media/2017/05/03/Springfield/Springfield/636294151161868489-pittapril21017.jpg?width=2993&height=1691&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/now/2018/02/07/celebrity-blog-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-continue-divorce-talks-privately/317020002/", "title": "Celebrity blog: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue divorce talks \u2014 privately", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Celebrity blog: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue divorce talks \u2014 privately", "description": "Currently, Jolie has custody of the six Jolie-Pitt children.
