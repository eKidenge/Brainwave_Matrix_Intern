There aren\u2019t enough hours in the day to sit down and count all of her virtues.\n\n(Getty)\n\nShe\u2019s just the best, OK?\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a human being who walks this earth, then you surely know that.\n\nIt just makes sense that since Rihanna is such a treasure to us all, she\u2019s even more special to the men she dates \u2014 and since last year, she\u2019s been dating billionaire Hassan Jameel.\n\nHassan is the deputy president and vice chairman of his family\u2019s company, which owns the rights to sell Toyota cars in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much more about him, since he and Rihanna have been keeping their relationship very private.\n\n(Getty)\n\nBut we do know that they\u2019ve been dating for close to a year now, and that they definitely seem serious about each other.\n\nSo that\u2019s nice, right? It\u2019s good to see Rihanna with someone who isn\u2019t an aggressive, violent, hateful, scary douchebag.\n\nAnd speaking of Chris Brown \u2026\n\nIt seems like while Chris isn\u2019t exactly an issue in Rihanna and Hassan\u2019s relationship, Hassan is concerned about him.\n\nA source tells Hollywood Life that \"He is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past.\"\n\n(Getty)\n\nGee, wonder why?\n\n\"Hassan doesn\u2019t trust Chris,\" the source adds, \"and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.\"\n\n\"He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.\"\n\nHis concerns may be valid \u2014 another source claims that even after all this time and even though Rihanna has clearly moved on, Chris is still hung up on her.\n\n\"Chris thinks Hassan is not good enough for Rihanna \u2014 but then, nobody would be good enough for her in his eyes,\" this insider states.\n\nHe\u2019s including himself in that, right? He can\u2019t think that he\u2019s good enough for her. Right?!\n\n\"He thinks there\u2019s no way Rihanna would marry this dude, which is kinda funny really as he doesn\u2019t know Hassan at all,\" the source continues.\n\n\"Chris just can\u2019t help it though, even after all these years, and all the water that\u2019s passed under the bridge, he still loves Rihanna to pieces and he still thinks of her as being his girl.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s totally crazy, but Chris still holds out this belief that one day, somehow, he and Rihanna will get back together and live happily after,\" the insider concludes.\n\nNo wonder Hassan has some concerns.\n\nEspecially when Chris has referred to himself as a stalker in the past, and has made statements like \"If I love you, bitch, ain\u2019t nobody gonna have you, I\u2019m gonna make you miserable.\"\n\nWe\u2019d say we don\u2019t have the best feeling about this, but we never have good feelings when it comes to Chris Brown.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/rihanna-chills-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1217_jessicasimpson_header-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/rihanna-valerian-premiere-photo-1024x974.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/rihanna-chills-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Tammy-Slaton-love-life-121324-tout-e7853cd79a78414b8187ad6ea14b4899-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1215_sydneysweeney_header-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/chris-brown-at-premiere-748x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1699256276-3-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/thg-placeholder.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1931427985-7-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1215_meghanmarkle_princeharry_header-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/rihanna-chills-660x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1217_justintimberlake_header-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1217_captainjason_02-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/kailyn-lowry-on-teen-mom-two-320x240.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/rihanna-chills-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Trainham"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/01/rihanna-boyfriend-hassan-jameel-warning-chris-brown-to-stay-away/", "title": "Rihanna: Boyfriend Hassan Jameel Warning Chris Brown to Stay Away?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rihanna: Boyfriend Hassan Jameel Warning Chris Brown to Stay Away?!", "description": "Rihanna is ... well, there's no real way to communicate with mere words how amazing Rihanna is.
