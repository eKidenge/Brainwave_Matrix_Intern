The actor also claims Hewitt was \u201cextremely intoxicated.\u201d\n\nHe further says in his suit that he \u201cwas raised by women in a household where women\u2019s rights, feminism, and advocacy were very much at the forefront, and he is sickened to have been falsely accused of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nPhillippe tweeted on Wednesday after the news of his lawsuit broke, writing, \u201cto be clear: i have not had a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d for over a year now & have barely dated anyone since. any other labels or mis- characterizations, from media or gossips, related to anyone, briefly, connected to my personal life, are false.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201chappy thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nAuthorities closed the criminal investigation regarding domestic violence against the actor in September. Hewitt filed a civil lawsuit in September against him for allegedly kicking, punching and throwing her down the stairs after an argument.\n\nIn court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Hewitt claimed that on July 3, Phillippe \u2014 who shares two children with ex-wife Reese Witherspoon and one with actress Alexis Knapp \u2014 left a party after \u201cbeing ignored [by Hewitt].\u201d\n\nHewitt alleges that she then went to Phillippe\u2019s house with a friend to pack up her things in the early hours of July 4, and a physical altercation ensued.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ryan Phillippe\u2019s Model Ex Files Lawsuit Accusing Him of Brutally Beating Her in Drunken Rage\n\nA spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to PEOPLE that officers filed a report of the alleged attack and granted Hewitt an emergency protective order. The order expired July 12.\n\nIn court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Hewitt claims that she saw Phillippe \u2014 whom she had been dating since April but split from in July \u2014 \u201crepeatedly abusing a panoply of legal and illegal drugs, including without limitation: cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and steroids \u2026 \u201d\n\nThe model alleges Phillippe \u201cincreasingly combined these drugs with excessive alcohol consumption and often exhibited symptoms attendant of poly drug and alcohol abuse, including mood swings and bouts of anger.\u201d\n\nKeith Fink, Hewitt\u2019s lawyer, previously slammed any suggestion that his client had filed the suit for fame and money, telling PEOPLE the model wants to take a stand against domestic violence.\n\nHewitt, who supplied a number of photographs of bruising and injuries she alleges she obtained from the altercation, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after the incident, where police issued the emergency protective order and filed a report.\n\nThe model claims she suffered chest wall pain, abrasions and severe bruising. She is asking for $1 million.", "images":
