One local told Vanity Fair: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear they want to be left alone. \u201cThe property is in the middle of woodland and you wouldn\u2019t know it was there. \u201cIt is very remote which is why they like it. It\u2019s like a fortress.\n\n\u201cThey both expect a code of silence\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Last month Mr Markle provocatively claimed that Princess Diana would have \u201cloathed\u201d the way he was being treated by the Royal Family. Royal editor Camilla Tominey commented: \u201cThey have both been extremely upset by Thomas Markle\u2019s behaviour and that of Meghan\u2019s half sister Samantha and other relatives.\n\n\u201cThey
