Karl might have to re-do them. Could write a sitcom around his hairstyles.\u201d\n\nAlongside the video, she also proclaimed that right now \u201cice is my best friend.\u201d\n\nIn a separate video, Cuoco also shared that her dog Ruby seemed really happy the actress was staying at home while she recovered from the procedure.\n\n\u201cRuby is so happy I had surgery because she just gets to lay and stare at me for hours on end,\u201d she remarked in the video, before asking the canine, \u201cIs this your dream?\u201d\n\nKaley Cuoco/Instagram\n\nThe actress previously revealed that although she underwent surgery a mere five days after tying the knot with husband Karl Cook, a surprise injury wasn\u2019t responsible for the procedure.\n\n\u201cThis was a planned surgery I\u2019ve had for over a year,\u201d she explained in her Instagram Story earlier this week.\n\n\u201cI hurt [my shoulder] over a year ago and did not need immediate surgery so brilliantly planned it five days after our wedding,\u201d she continued. \u201cI knew I\u2019d have a babysitter.\u201d\n\nKaley Cuoco/Instagram\n\nShe also added that she plans to \u201clay low\u201d during the recovery process, which could last up to six weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a pretty big cast. No horsies for a minute. Time to lay low and hopefully not kill this guy,\u201d she said as she panned the camera over to Cook. \u201cOr him kill me.\u201d\n\nKaley Cuoco/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: How Kaley Cuoco Achieved Her \u2018Effortless and Natural\u2019 Wedding Day Look\n\nThe actress first revealed her surgery on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhen your \u2018honeymoon\u2019 is shoulder surgery and your husband looks just as happy lol on the road to recovery,\u201d the actress captioned a hospital selfie on Instagram.\n\n\u201cThank you for all the love and support! knowing @mrtankcook I\u2019m sure he will be posting tons of hilarious gems,\u201d the newly married Cuoco added.\n\nRight on cue, Cook, 27, went on to share a photo of his wife in the hospital, captioning it: \u201cEveryone has their own version of a newlywed glow\u2026.well @normancook yours is memorable #shouldersurgeryhoneymoon.\u201d", "images":
