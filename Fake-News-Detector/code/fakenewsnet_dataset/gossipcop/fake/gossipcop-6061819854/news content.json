Read our privacy policy\n\nMeryl Streep has called Harvey Weinstein \u201cdisgraceful\u201d over the sexual harassment allegations made against the Hollywood producer.\n\nThe Academy Award-winner issued a statement to The Huffington Post, revealing she was not aware of Weinstein\u2019s behaviour before the allegations were made public.\n\nStreep has collaborated with Weinstein on numerous projects, including August: Osage County and The Iron Lady, even once referring to him as a \u201cGod\u201d.\n\nWeinstein has been accused of sexually harassing numerous women over the past few decades, the producer having reportedly paid eight individuals to keep the story quiet.\n\nMany critics, including Donald Trump Jnr, have been vocal about Hollywood not discussing the Weinstein situation. The Daily Beast even used an image of the producer with Streep for an article titled: \u201cHollywood\u2019s Loud Silence on Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Sexual Harassment Allegations.\u201d\n\nStreep\u2019s full statement reads: \u201cThe disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes.\n\n\u201cOne thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about these other offences: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don\u2019t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.\n\n\u201cThe behaviour is inexcusable but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.\u201d\n\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days New subscribers only. \u00a38.99/mo. after free trial.
