There\u2019s nothing more to it.\u2019\n\nAccording to reports, Justin has been busy \u2018doing his thing\u2019 in New York, while Aniston remained in LA.\n\nA source told People: \u2018Now, he\u2019s apparently just enjoying the single life in New York and sticking to a pretty basic routine. He\u2019s just doing his thing. He eats at the same time, goes to the same places, hangs with the same people.\u2019\n\n\u2026getting coffee with curly-haired brunettes\u2026\n\nNow if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll just be down here doing push ups.\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
