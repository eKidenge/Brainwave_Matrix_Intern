And his choice of would be girlfriend, revealed exclusively to New Idea, is none other than his former co-star and one-time fling, Jennifer Aniston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018David\u2019s always held a candle for Jen and has never stopped loving her,\u2019 a friend of David\u2019s explains.\n\n\u2018He even admits how he felt \u201cdesperately low\u201d when she got engaged to Brad and how he felt a glimmer of hope when they divorced. But it was a case of never being the right time as one of them was always in a relationship after their fling all those years ago.\u2019\n\nAfter Jennifer, 49, split from Justin Theroux, 46, David made sure he got in touch with her to offer his support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\n\u2018He\u2019s been calling and texting Jen over the last few months since her split from Justin \u2013 being a shoulder for her to lean on and proving that he can be a rock for her in her darkest times.\u2019\n\nWhile David\u2019s currently in London working on an executive producing gig for the BBC, he\u2019s been in constant touch with his former on-screen girlfriend. And because he\u2019s so keen to find a way to work with his old colleague and crush again, they\u2019ve been discussing future projects.\n\n\u2018David\u2019s made no secret to pals that he wants Jen back and he\u2019s been doing everything he can to try to make that happen \u2013 putting her up for a role in the BBC adaptation of Love, which he\u2019s executive producing, suggesting film roles and even talking about reunion plans again all so he can try to win back her affections.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid, 51, split from Zoe Buckman, 32, his English wife of seven years and mum to their seven-year-old daughter Cleo, in April 2017, just 10 months before Jennifer and Justin announced their break-up.\n\nSince then Jennifer has been linked with ex-husband Brad Pitt and as New Idea reported, there are rumours she\u2019s expecting a baby.\n\n\u2018David\u2019s feelings for Jen have always been strong but he says they\u2019ve become stronger since her split from Justin and he\u2019s fallen for her again \u2013 saying this time around he\u2019s going to do everything in his power to win her over and he says he won\u2019t let her slip through his fingers again,\u2019 explains the pal.\n\nRelated: Jennifer Aniston spotted wearing an engagement ring\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nThe would-be couple, once known as Ross and Rachel, have always been very open about their mutual admiration. After they began working together on their hit television series Friends, rumours quickly spread that the romance they portrayed on the small screen was mirrored in their real lives.\n\nDavid described Jennifer as \u2018adorable\u2019 and \u2018amazing\u2019, and even told Oprah Winfrey back in 2003 when the hit TV show ended: \u2018Jen, she amazes me. A really generous, warm, warm person.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer has been equally gushing about David, calling him \u2018talented\u2019 and \u2018dreamy\u2019, and even admitting back in their Friends heyday that: \u2018I\u2019d be attracted to him. I love that sweet puppy-dog-eyed kind of thing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated: Jennifer Aniston is \u2018ready to date again\u2019\n\nTheir former co-stars are desperate to see the pair finally face their long-held feelings and get together.\n\n\u2018Courteney, Lisa, Matt, and Matthew all know about David\u2019s plan to win her back and are fully supportive of his plan \u2013 with Courteney even offering to help in whatever way she can as they\u2019re all gunning for them to get together,\u2019 explains the insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Finally seeing David and Jen would be a dream come true for everyone so their loved ones have all got their fingers crossed that they can finally have their happy ending \u2013 just like Ross and Rachel.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea, on sale now.", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2023/12/Carols-Featured-image-template.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au//wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/30455/ni-july-20.jpg?resize=1024%2C655", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/136401/nicole-richie-kids-2.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Untitled-design-5.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/11/NIW_2441_Magshop-and-eDM-cover.jpg?resize=444%2C579", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f4dc259cb1b48dc9cc9278500f8084d5?s=128&d=mm&r=g", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Copy-of-Site-Horizontal.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/30406/untitled-design-8.png?resize=1200%2C630", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/New-Header-1-5.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/132096/untitled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au//wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/30406/untitled-design-8.png?resize=1024%2C546", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/132172/untitled-design-2023-12-05t113134682.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/30406/untitled-design-8.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Hosts-interview-Featured-image-template.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/132452/pac-header.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Untitled-design-81.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/09/New-Header-24.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/New-Header-9.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/PAC-Header.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au//wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/30405/gettyimages-143479491-scaled.jpg?resize=900%2C1023"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/30406/untitled-design-8.png?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikki Black", "Nikki Is Obsessed With All Things Celebrity", "Dreams She Is A Long-Lost Kardashian.
