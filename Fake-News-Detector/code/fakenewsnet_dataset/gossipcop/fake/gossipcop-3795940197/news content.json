According to a new report, after the sisters bared their bodies in various nearly nude and bikini photos on Instagram, Jenner believes the twosome are \u201csetting a poor example for their young children.\u201d\n\nAt least that\u2019s according to Hollywood Life, as the outlet alleged this week that an insider recently revealed that Caitlyn thinks the twosome\u2019s photos are \u201cin poor taste\u201d and are \u201cpoorly timed\u201d amid the important message being spread by the #MeToo movement right now.\n\nA source alleged to the site that \u201cCaitlyn feels Kim and Kourtney are sending the wrong message to their millions of followers\u201d with their skin-baring pictures, as she\u2019s supposedly been trying for years to get the twosome to cover up a little more while she was married to former wife Kris Jenner before their divorce in 2015.\n\n\u201cCaitlyn worries that the sisters\u2019 inappropriate posts are setting a poor example for their young children,\u201d said the source of the star, who reports are claiming could potentially join the cast of Dancing with the Stars Season 26 later this year.\n\nNotably, both stars are moms to three young children. Kim and husband Kanye West are parents to 4-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint, and almost 2-week-old Chicago, while Kourtney is mom to 8-year-old Mason, 5-year-old Penelope, and 3-year-old Reign.\n\nJenner hasn\u2019t yet confirmed the claims made by the outlet this week and hasn\u2019t spoken publicly regarding her former stepdaughter\u2019s risque snaps, though the site\u2019s insider then added that Caitlyn allegedly \u201cwishes both Kim and Kourtney would behave with more style and grace\u201d after posting the provocative photos to their Instagram accounts, which have racked up millions of likes.\n\n\u201cThey are mothers and Caitlyn feels they should behave more responsibly and conservatively,\u201d added Hollywood Life\u2019s insider.\n\nThe report comes after both Kim and Kourtney hit the headlines for showing off a whole lot of skin on their respective Instagram pages over the past few weeks.\n\nKim\u2019s been posting a number of risqu\u00e9 snaps both before and after the birth of her third child, daughter Chicago, who she and Kanye welcomed via a surrogate on January 15.\n\nMost recently, Kardashian posted a bathroom mirror selfie to the social media site which showed her topless and wearing only sparkly underwear.\n\nKim\u2019s big sister Kourtney Kardashian hasn\u2019t been doing much covering up on Instagram either, as she\u2019s been sharing a number of bikini photos with her followers from her vacation in Mexico, including a NSFW photo of herself laying on a sun lounger in a tiny bikini.\n\nBut while Caitlyn hasn\u2019t confirmed reports claiming she thinks Kim and Kourtney aren\u2019t setting the best example for their followers or their children, the claims come shortly after the star slammed the Kardashian clan in an interview with former America\u2019s Got Talent judge Piers Morgan.\n\nSpeaking out about her former family members on the British series Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories earlier this month, Jenner admitted that she no longer speaks to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians stars and said that she couldn\u2019t trust them with the news of her transition because she believed they\u2019d leak the news to the press.\n\n\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t trust them,\u201d Caitlyn said of Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner after admitting that she knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her secret before she was ready to reveal the news herself.\n\nSpeaking of her tell-all book The Secrets of My Life, Jenner then added, \u201cI hate to inform the Kardashians that the book was not about them.\u201d", "images": ["https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/726031/uploads/b5421d40-b6cb-11ef-ac0e-61213da88aad_800_420.jpeg", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/728517/uploads/af9ac920-b886-11ef-94a7-5fd0e99ef91d_800_420.jpeg", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/728308/uploads/ca596ff0-b7b4-11ef-ab11-8f7333fbac22_800_420.jpeg", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/google-follow-us.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/728960/uploads/5f97cb80-bbab-11ef-9eed-35110b6ac994_800_420.jpeg", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/727738/uploads/ec554500-b496-11ef-a728-81e378d9bfd8_800_420.jpeg", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Hutchinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4757224/caitlyn-jenner-kim-kourtney-kardashian-setting-poor-example-children", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Reportedly Thinks Kim & Kourtney Kardashian Are \u2018Setting A Poor Example For Their Children\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner allegedly isn&#8217;t too fond of the risqu\u00e9 photos her former stepdaughters Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian have been sharing across their social media pages in recent days.
