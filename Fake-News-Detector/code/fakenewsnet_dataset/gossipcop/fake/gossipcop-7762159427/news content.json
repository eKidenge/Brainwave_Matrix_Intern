Rather than sitting at home alone, however, he decided to go out for sushi, and took fans along for the ride on his Instagram Story. (Other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360-degree look at what it's like to have dinner with Justin.)\n\nOf course, this move is a statement, and not a subtle one at that. TMZ reportedly spoke to a source that said Justin \"doesn't think the Grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers.\"\n\nRegardless, choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations, and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect.\n\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nHowever, this wasn't the only questionable act that went down on Justin's Instagram Live feed this weeknd. He also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him, \"Favorite song at the moment?\" He pauses, and then replies: \"'Starboy,' by The Weeknd,\" before bursting out into laughter, making it clear that the comment was sarcastic. You then hear the second voice in the video say: \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta end it now. That was too funny.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/676035fd142847d7d85f75bc/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/66e495b75f3b86c1f63138f8/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/67609553a13dcee5bde934e1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/66cde071ffb380ce4eb8e1c9/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a21028370748b21532f1f8/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-492971831.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1732293121/teenvogue_character-study-tv-character-study-wicked-cast.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/66696de6cf4c71ee4dc3076a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6582d5d46133bae913ebab03/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a210476d33d9e97bc047f0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6731e0e7cbe3cf51065ccef8/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a3b2049f01b6d6b153e9a84/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/67504ff614ffc7e10d16d674/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/675984042f1809b72565f931/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6740b29db0b9a21ccb49d525/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6755dae0dbc76c94368a06ae/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a210476d33d9e97bc047f0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianna Wiest"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-grammys-2017-instagram-live-eats-sushi", "title": "Justin Bieber Doesn't Attend Grammys 2017 and Eats Sushi Instead", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Brianna Wiest", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2024", "description": "Despite earning four nominations, Justin Bieber fails to attend the Grammys 2017 and shares an Instagram story of him eating sushi instead.", "id": "58a1d91c6d33d9e97bc047a4", "keywords": "justin bieber,the weeknd,grammys,grammys 2017, instagram", "news_keywords": "justin bieber,the weeknd,grammys,grammys 2017, instagram", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58a1d91c6d33d9e97bc047a4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Despite earning four nominations, Justin Bieber fails to attend the Grammys 2017 and shares an Instagram story of him eating sushi instead.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a21028370748b21532f1f8/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-492971831.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a21028370748b21532f1f8/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-492971831.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The Weeknd was involved...", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a210476d33d9e97bc047f0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "This Is What Justin Bieber Did Instead of Going to the Grammys", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-grammys-2017-instagram-live-eats-sushi"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-02-13T20:02:00.165Z", "modified_time": "2017-02-13T20:02:00.165Z", "author": "Brianna Wiest"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "The Weeknd was involved...", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a210476d33d9e97bc047f0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "This Is What Justin Bieber Did Instead of Going to the Grammys"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58a210476d33d9e97bc047f0/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1487016120.165, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
