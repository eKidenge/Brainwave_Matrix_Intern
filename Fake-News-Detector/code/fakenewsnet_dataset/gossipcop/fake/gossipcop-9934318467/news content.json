(Picture: Black Label Media/REX)\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling used body doubles for La La Land\u2019s most complex dance scene, a shocking new report has claimed.\n\nThe sensational report throws the film\u2019s integrity into question, given that it was widely reported how the two stars of the film underwent intense dance training for their roles, of which Emma won an Oscar for.\n\nBut according to a film insider, the iconic Griffith Observatory scene, which is thought of as the film\u2019s most intricate dance sequence in which Emma and Ryan fly through the observatory, apparently looked so good because it was crafted by professional dancers and not Emma and Ryan.\n\nIs that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling dancing\u2026 or body doubles? (Picture: Lionsgate)\n\nA stunt double allegedly used in the film has told The Sun how Ryan had two doubles for his dance scenes, whilst Emma\u2019s moves were performed for her by pro-dancer Emilie Livingston, who is the dancer wife of Jeff Goldblum.\n\n\u2018Ryan had three stunt doubles \u2014 two were dancers \u2014 and Emma\u2019s dancing was done by Emilie Livingston,\u2019 the inside tole The Sun On Sunday.\n\n\u2018The sequence where they danced in the clouds was filmed on a platform and was not Ryan and Emma.\u2019\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling filmed a magical scene in the Griffith Observatory for La La Land (Picture: Lionsgate)\n\nClaiming film makers had tried silencing the dancers on the use of doubles, the source added: \u2018Lots of people have been asking what really went on and we have been contacted by the studio, told off for talking and sworn to silence.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not fair but they were insistent we shouldn\u2019t tell anyone there were doubles for the dancing.\u2019\n\nLionsgate were apparently quizzed on the use of dancing doubles in February but denied the claims, staying that, \u2018both Ryan and Emma trained for three months intensively and everything you see is their work\u2019, according to the newspaper.\n\nHowever, the film production company has now released a contradictory statement which confirms the use of doubles, specifically in that iconic Griffith Observatory scene.\n\n\u2018Doubles were used for some silhouette turns in the latter half of the observatory scene,\u2019 the statement reads.\n\nLivingston is credited on La La Land\u2019s IMDB page, described as a \u2018stunt double\u2019 for Mia, the role Emma played.\n\nIf Lionsgate did indeed originally deny stunt doubles were used, it\u2019s no surprise, given that February would have been in the middle of awards season.\n\nAn industry source further explained to The Sun: \u2018The film\u2019s campaign was quite heavily built around how amazing it was that Emma and Ryan had learned to sing, dance and play piano for the movie.\n\n\u2018But in the observatory scene it\u2019s obvious, if you pay attention, that the silhouettes are not them. Suddenly, their dancing turns from being nice enough, to amazingly poised.\u2019\n\nLa La Land is out on DVD next month.\n\nArrow MORE: Emma Stone has responded to the teen who asked her to prom with
