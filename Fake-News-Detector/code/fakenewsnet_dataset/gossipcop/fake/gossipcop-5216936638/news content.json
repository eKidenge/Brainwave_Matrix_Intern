The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were married on May 19 in a romantic ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor Castle \u2013 less than two years after it is rumoured the pair met in the summer of 2016. Ms Cox told Express.co.uk: \u201cThey got married right in the middle of the honeymoon period when your brain is just flooded by love and sexual hormones and your judgement is completely skew. \"And now, anyone looking at them can tell they are absolutely smack bang in the middle, they are infatuated, they are at the lust stage, they are that wonderful stage everyone wants to stay at.\"\n\nWhen asked if the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's relationship differs from Prince William and Kate's, the expert suggested they could not be more contrasting. Ms Cox said: \u201cMeghan and Harry they are still getting to know each other. \u201cThey are in the early, early, early stages.\u201d \u201cWilliam and Kate have known each other since they were at university.\u201d\n\nLOVE BIRDS.....Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still getting to know each other\n\nShe added: \u201cYou are looking at old love versus new love.\u201d According to Ms Cox, the reason why Meghan and Harry's are still in their honeymoon stage is because of the secrecy they had to keep while dating. She said: \u201cIt is lasting so long for them because they haven\u2019t seen each other that much. \"They hardly saw each other before and it was all in secret.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
