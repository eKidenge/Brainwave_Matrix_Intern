While most of the new articles reiterate what was reported initially after the split\u2014that Aniston wasn't planning on being single again but still believes in love, that their relationship had been on its last legs for a while, that a Brad Pitt-Jen reconciliation is highly unlikely\u2014one of the wilder new details is straight from Us Weekly. Apparently, Jennifer Aniston kept Post-Its that Brad Pitt wrote her when they were married. And Justin Theroux found them, a source said!\n\n\u201cHe stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,\u201d the source explained. \u201cSweet little Post-its like, \u2018You looked nice tonight\u2019 or \u2018Miss you already.\u2019\u201d These little notes supposedly had a big impact on their relationship. \u201cJen assured him they weren\u2019t a big deal, but Justin wasn\u2019t thrilled\u2026Justin had moments of insecurity like that.\u201d\n\nPeople really tried to shoot down the reports that Brad-Jen 2.0 could happen last week. \u201cThey\u2019ve been over each other for longer than they were ever together,\u201d a source, with knowledge of Pitt and Aniston's current relationship, told the outlet then. \u201cNow you add six kids on his side and each of them having their own assorted battle scars into the mix? Forget it. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nPlus, \u201cthey aren\u2019t in regular contact, beyond an occasional text back and forth to wish each other the best when there\u2019s been a new project or big event,\u201d the source added. Most brutally, the source said, \u201cThey broke up, and they did it because they had serious issues. They\u2019re not stupid. They remember why it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThat said, another source told The Blast yesterday that while Aniston and Pitt getting back together isn't about to happen now, they have talked recently. And \u201csomething crazy could happen, [but] at this point nothing is going down between them.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-burn-ballads-babyface-ak-v1-65283d375ffe8.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-and-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-news-photo-1734378843.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.724xh;0,0.0800xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/megan-fox-mgk-gettyimages-1402022051-1-676198e9de149.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.920xh;0,0.0413xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-jen-brad-1519246939.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber-attend-the-2021-met-gala-news-photo-1631970523.jpg?crop=0.771xw:1.00xh;0.115xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-timothee-gettyimages-1487018243-1-64dd38c069d6b.jpg?crop=0.489xw:0.978xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gigi-hadid-bradley-cooper-gettyimages-1716549865-6525abd8b6578.jpg?crop=0.464xw:0.928xh;0.0261xw,0.0228xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-jen-brad-1519246939.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/royalsasteens-6616b69e95976.jpg?crop=0.669xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.242fea1.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/saved.ad81f1a.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/close.38e3324.svg?primary=%2523FFF9EE", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bradley-cooper-and-gigi-hadid-are-seen-in-noho-on-november-news-photo-1734371406.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.667xh;0,0.0522xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2183300735-67323b3be4d58.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.776xh;0,0.0211xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-are-seen-on-october-11-2024-news-photo-1734386059.pjpeg?crop=0.964xw:1.00xh;0.00559xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-timothee-gettyimages-1908171305-1-67607bafa501f.jpg?crop=0.577xw:0.863xh;0.0578xw,0.137xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/tiktok.603c377.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bowen-yang-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slater-attend-the-wicked-news-photo-1734455329.pjpeg?crop=0.707xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hailey-justin-1-6760758489c85.jpg?crop=0.927xw:1.00xh;0.0289xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/close.38e3324.svg"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-jen-brad-1519246939.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a18569632/justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-love-note-post-its-report/", "title": "Justin Theroux Found Jennifer Aniston's Love Note Post-Its From Brad Pitt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Justin Theroux Found Jennifer Aniston's Love Note Post-Its From Brad Pitt - Jen Saved Brad Pitt Notes From Marriage", "description": "One of the wilder new details on Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's divorce to come out is straight from Us Weekly.
