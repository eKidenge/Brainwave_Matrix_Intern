Now they\u2019re bonding over being pregnant together.\u2019\n\nWhile the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.\n\nFor Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an \u2018enormous relief.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,\u2019 a palace insider says, not only because of her age but \u2018because it didn\u2019t happen with her first husband,\u2019 producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.\n\n(Credit: In Touch)\n\nThe pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children \u2018felt like a huge weight on Meghan\u2019s shoulders,\u2019 says the source.\n\n\u2018Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile Prince William, 36, was \u2018initially shocked when Kate told him he\u2019s going to be a dad again\u2019, but now he sees it as a \u2018happy surprise.\u2019\n\n\u2018He and Kate have always wanted four kids,\u2019 the source tells.\n\nAnd this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.\n\nRelated: Confirmed: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle

eat and is advising her on how to balance motherhood with life as a royal,\u2019 says the source.\n\nFitness enthusiast Meghan, whose mother Doria Ragland is a yoga instructor, is returning the favour by teaching Kate pregnancy yoga.\n\nThe publication adds that the two pregnant women are happily letting their husbands dote on them.\n\n\u2018William is doing his best to help Kate relax by being a hands-on father to George, Louis and Charlotte,\u2019 says the source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He brings Kate tea and cookies in bed,\u2019 including lavender biscuits which are known to help with nausea.\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nKate, adds the source, is \u2018convinced she\u2019s having another girl because she\u2019s having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.\u2019\n\nMeghan is hoping for one of each \u2013 a boy and a girl \u2013 the insider tells In Touch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is a dream come true for both couples.\u2019\n\nThe royal
