REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo\n\nMTV said on Monday that \u201cLohan Beach Club\u201d will follow the actress as she works to expand a recently launched nightclub and restaurant business in Greece.\n\nThe TV network said the show, expected to air in 2019, will see Lohan, 32, lead a team of \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d who will help promote her business \u201cwhile striving to rise above the temptations the Mykonos night life scene has to offer.\u201d\n\nLohan, once one of Hollywood\u2019s most-sought after young actresses after starring roles in \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d and \u201cMean Girls,\u201d went to rehab six times between 2007 and 2013, and was in and out of jail and court repeatedly for offenses ranging from theft to drunken driving and drug possession.\n\nHer last feature movie was the 2013 low-budget thriller \u201cThe Canyons\u201d after which she moved to London, and later Dubai. Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy \u201cSick Note,\u201d in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.\n\nThe Mykonos beach club is Lohan\u2019s third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.", "images":
