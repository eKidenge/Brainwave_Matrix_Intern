It reads: \u201cAs Lady Gaga\u2018s legal team will present to the court, she has provided all of the relevant information in her possession and is at most an ancillary witness in this process. Dr. Luke\u2019s team is attempting to manipulate the truth and draw press attention to their case by exaggerating Lady Gaga\u2018s role and falsely accusing her of dodging reasonable requests.\u201d\n\nDr. Luke is continuing his defamation lawsuit against Kesha. The music producer has now subpoenaed Lady Gaga for a deposition for her involvement in the case.\n\n\u201cDr. Luke\u2019s counsel served a subpoena on Lady Gaga because she has relevant information regarding, among other things, false statements about Dr. Luke made to her by Kesha,\u201d said Dr. Luke\u2019s lawyer in a statement on Saturday. \u201cThis motion has become necessary because Dr. Luke\u2019s counsel has not been able to obtain, despite repeated request, a deposition date from Lady Gaga.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAccording to a TMZ report, Lady Gaga did submit a written statement, but redacted too much of the content to prove useful. She could now be required to attend a 3-hour, sit-down interview instead.\n\nLady Gaga has publicly supported Kesha throughout her sexual assault case against Dr. Luke \u2014 including tweeting #FreeKesha \u2014 and is said to have exchanged text messages with the pop star.\n\n\u201cIn connection with Dr. Luke\u2019s defamation claims against Kesha, various third parties are being deposed by both sides, including celebrities,\u201d his lawyer\u2019s statement also confirmed.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the usage of \u201ccelebrities\u201d \u2014 plural \u2014 meaning other A-listers may find themselves on the stand.\n\nDr. Luke previously sued Kesha\u2019s mother Pebe Sebert for defamation in 2014 and 2016, but dropped the suits in June.", "images":
