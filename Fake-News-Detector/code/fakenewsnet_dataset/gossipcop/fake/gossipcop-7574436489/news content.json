However, Bendjima denied anything was going on between the pair.\n\nKKHLOE KARDASHIAN EXPLAINS HER 'PREGNANCY LIPS'\n\n\"They really want me to be the bad guy,\" Bendjima wrote on an Instagram story Tuesday, including a screenshot of a Daily Mail article about his \"rebound\" girl. \"F--- your Hollywood bulls--- (can't have fun with your friends no more).\"\n\nBendjima then posted several photos of his friends playing in the sand.\n\n\"I'm not attached to this 'life' so you can't touch me,\" he continued. \"I know who I am where I'm from and where I'm going and that bothers you ... only one opinion matter the one of my Lord.\"\n\nNews of the split comes just weeks after Bendjima trolled the \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star's revealing bikini picture on Instagram.\n\nKIM AND KHLOE KARDASHIAN FIGHT WITH KOURTNEY OVER MONTHS-LONG FEUD IN LIVE TWITTER FIGHT\n\n\u201cThats what you need to show to get likes?\u201d he said in a since-deleted comment.\n\nMany Kardashian fans took issue with Bendjima's comment, though the model claims it was just a joke, according to Us Weekly.\n\nKardashian began dating Bendjima in 2016 after years of on-again-off-again romance with Disick, with whom she shares three children, Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3.\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report.", "images":
