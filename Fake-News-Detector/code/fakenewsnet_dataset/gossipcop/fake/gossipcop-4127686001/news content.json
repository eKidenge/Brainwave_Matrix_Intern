{"url": "www.newidea.com.au/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-second-wedding-report", "text": "In the wake of her high-profile split to Brad Pitt in 2005, Jennifer Aniston said: \u2018What\u2019s fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person, and looking across the room and saying, \u2018I\u2019m still here, and I still love you\u2019.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You have marriages within marriages\u2026that\u2019s what I want in marriage,\u2019 she added at the time.\n\nThe now 49-year-old actress and her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who reunited shortly after Jen split from Justin Theroux in early 2018, have decided to give their failed marriage a second chance.\n\nMultiple insiders told In Touch, \u2018They are taking the biggest leap possible.\u2019\n\nAdding, \u2018Their shared dream of coming full circle, marrying again, is coming true.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtist impression of Brad and Jennifer\u2019s

have easy access to one of the most picturesque locations in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are aiming for an August ceremony and reception at George Clooney\u2019s villa in Lake Como, Italy,\u2019 a source spills to In Touch.\n\nBrad\u2019s longtime friend George, who let John Krasinski and Emily Blunt marry at his 18th-century estate in 2010, \u2018would be more than happy to host the nuptials.\u2019\n\nUnlike their 2000 wedding, which reportedly cost $1million, this second wedding joy will be \u2018smaller and more intimate,\u2019 according to friends.\n\nJen hopes to have a maximum of 14 guests, including George and wife Amal, best friend Courtney Cox and the six children Brad shares with estranged wife Angelina Jolie \u2013 Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 \u2013 for what an insider calls a \u2018classy, white-themed wedding.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad\u2019s mother Jane will also reportedly be in attendance.\n\n\u2018Jane always loved Jen,\u2019 a friend told In Touch. \u2018So when Jane saw that there was an opening for Brad and Jen to find love again, she urged him to give it another shot.\u2019\n\nNow that Jen is back with Brad, the Hollywood starlet is happier than ever!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is the epic news that friends, family and fans have been hoping for since their split in 2005,\u2019 a source tells the US publication. \u2018Forget about the royal wedding \u2013 this is the wedding of the century.\u2019\n\nNeither Jen or Brad have responded to In Touch\u2019s report.", "images":
