If not, \u201cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\u201d is unlikely to seduce you. NBC\u2019s special edition of the faux newscast stretches the segment and adds a commercial break, which that means more than ever its success rests not on the momentum of the evening, the charisma of the host, or the enthusiasm of the studio audience but on the talents and chemistry of anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che. Those two are still grappling with a stilted awkwardness in their \u201cWeekend Update\u201d personas that make them both less engaging than they would otherwise be on their own. But as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has enjoyed a resurgence in ratings and cultural relevancy, Jost\u2019s and Che\u2019s growing pains have smoothed out into a predictable dynamic.\n\nTonight\u2019s premiere of \u201cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\u201d had the advantage of a ton of Trump-related material to work with and several guest appearances: \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Leslie Jones, featured cast members Mikey Day and Alex Moffat, and alum Bill Hader (in a committed impression as Anthony Scaramucci). Jost\u2019s biggest laugh \u2014 one punctuated with gasps and groans \u2014 came from a remark about how even President Franklin Roosevelt knew when to stand up. Che, meanwhile, found his sweet spot in the midst of a long analogy about how the Statue of Liberty had gotten \u201cbougie\u201d lately, which ended with his exclamation: \u201cBitch, you ain\u2019t China!\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nStill, with the news being what it is \u2014 and with so many other shows in the satirical news space \u2014 the humor didn\u2019t quite match up to the material. During the regular season, \u201cWeekend Update\u201d gets a handicap precisely because it is buried in the middle of a 90-minute live sketch show with just one week to throw everything together. On its own, the premiere of the summer edition was a reminder of how sharp and hilarious the political satire game can be elsewhere.\n\nWhere \u201cWeekend Update\u201d can stand out is in its commitment to things that aren\u2019t funny-ish one-liners based on headlines. That\u2019s why Jones\u2019 appearances as a randomly horny version of herself are always so welcome. Oddly, the best joke of the night was Moffat as Eric Trump, aah-ing over a fidget spinner, maybe because it barely had to be written at all: Moffat just stared at it, while Day (as Donald Jr.) spun it for him.\n\nWith the threat of nuclear war in the headlines, it\u2019s nice that \u201cWeekend Update\u201d is around for the summer to add a little more levity to a news cycle that is full of fire and fury. And for fans of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d \u201cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\u201d promises to feature contributions from a number of the show\u2019s key cast members during the next few weeks, providing a nice holdover until the mothership returns for Season 43 in the fall.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TOM2_205_BC_0283R.jpg?w=250&h=167&crop=1",
