The show, titled Gwen Stefani \u2014 Just a Girl, is good. In fact, it's hella good.\n\n\"This is a crazy night, okay, because this is the first night. I'll remember this for the rest of my life, so you guys have a huge responsibility,\" she told the sold-out crowd early into the show. \"This is going to be an epic night tonight.\"\n\nOver the course of 100 minutes, Stefani sang her biggest hits, touching on songs from her solo career and her career with No Doubt. When Stefani announced the show in April she promised that the residency show would be b-a-n-a-n-a-s, and it was\u2026 literally. The first song of the show \u2014 \"Hollaback Girl\" \u2014 featured her dancers carrying oversized bananas.\n\nTodd Stefani\n\nTodd Stefani\n\nTodd Stefani\n\nSplash News\n\nDuring other songs, such as \"Simple Kind of Life,\" Stefani wore a makeshift wedding dress, and she harkened back to her ska roots with \"Sunday Morning,\" donning a midriff-bearing shirt and plaid pants.\n\nStefani wasn't afraid to incorporate her love life into the show either. In fact, she seemed to pay homage to boyfriend Blake Shelton as she dressed in a cowgirl outfit for \"Make Me Like You,\" a song she's said is about her beau.\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton. Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton\n\nShelton, as expected, was in attendance, even getting a standing ovation when he walked into the theater before settling in with Stefani's 4-year-old son Apollo in his lap.\n\n\"I see a lot of admiring eyes on my sparkles. I know, it's ridiculous,\" Stefani said. \"You don't know what it's like to wear a cowgirl costume right in front of Blake Shelton. It's like my fantasy come true.\"\n\nTodd Stefani\n\nAfter all the costume changes and the hits, the show at its core was, pardon the pun, a sweet escape. But, not only did Stefani give fans a musical trip down memory lane, but she gave her fans a deep dive into her personal life.\n\nDuring an interlude, Stefani spoke of her younger self, saying she envisioned herself with several kids and a \"perfect family.\"\n\n\"That's something I dreamed of for a long time,\" she said in a video during the show. \"But, my own love life experience wasn't what I thought it would be, and I feel like I had so much love to give inside me, but I was unlucky in love, which has been a blessing because I've been able to write about that and share that and have this incredibly blessed musical career.\"\n\nShe continued, \"There was a point in my life where I felt that I was losing everything \u2026 When I look back at all the times my heart was broken, it was always music that healed me.\"\n\nSplash News\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Gwen Stefani Reveals Blake Shelton Once Dated a Big Fan of Hers\n\nBefore the show even started, Stefani got a loving confidence boost from her man, as he tweeted his well-wishes and sent a bouquet of flowers to her dressing room.\n\n\"You've worked so hard on this show. Congrats on opening night!!!\" read his note on the bouquet. \"I love you. Blake.\"\n\nGwen Stefani/Instagram\n\nLove life aside, the show \u2014 the first of 25 \u2014 was all about the music and the experience, and Stefani left no doubt that she's ready to headline a Vegas residency.\n\nGwen Stefani \u2014 Just a Girl will run through mid-March 2019 at the Zappos Theater.", "images":
