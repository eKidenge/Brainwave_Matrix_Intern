USA! USA!\u201d from the audience, Trump\u2019s comments about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton also elicited boos from the crowd, which was highlighted by users on social media.\n\nFormer Chief Official White House Photographer Pete Souza made his own comparison between Obama and Trump via Instagram.\n\nCurrent Scout leaders and former Scouts, as well as parents, also used Twitter to voice their criticism of the nature of Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nAs a Scout leader, my stomach is in knots about what Trump did today. If you haven't watched it yet, don't. It's downright icky. \u2014 Chris Murphy \ud83d\udfe7 (@ChrisMurphyCT) July 25, 2017\n\nI'm an Eagle Scout. Trump using the 30,000 BoyScouts as his props tonight was a scene out of Triumph of the Will. Shocking abuse of children \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) July 25, 2017\n\nIn a statement, the Boy Scouts of America said that it is \u201cwholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy. The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies.\u201d", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-821810776.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-821810776.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suyin Haynes"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4872107/trump-boy-scout-speech-reactions/", "title": "Donald Trump: Reactions to 2017 Boy Scout Jamboree Speech", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#e90606", "description": "President Trump's speech at the 2017 Boy Scout Jamboree has drawn criticism, with some comparing the speech to a \"political rally\"", "application-name": "nextgen", "author": "Suyin Haynes", "creator": "Suyin Haynes", "category": "Politics", "fb": {"app_id": 991230477954201, "pages": 10606591490}, "primary-tag": "white-house", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published_time": "2017-07-25T05:28:14"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4872107/trump-boy-scout-speech-reactions/", "description": "\"Shocking abuse of children\"", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-821810776.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "amphtml": "https://time.com/4872107/trump-boy-scout-speech-reactions/?amp=true", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"title": "Past and Present Scouts React to Trump's Jamboree Speech", "description": "\"Shocking abuse of children\"", "url": "https://time.com/4872107/trump-boy-scout-speech-reactions/", "site_name": "TIME", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-821810776.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TIME", "title": "Past and Present Scouts React to Trump's Jamboree Speech", "description": "\"Shocking abuse of children\"", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-821810776.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
