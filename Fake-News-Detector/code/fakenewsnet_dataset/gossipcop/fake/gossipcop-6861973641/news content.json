He drew the very moral equivalency for which a bipartisan chorus, and his own advisers, had already criticized him.\n\n\u201cI think there is blame on both sides,\u201d the president said in a combative exchange with reporters at Trump Tower in Manhattan. \u201cYou had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I\u2019ll say it right now.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump defended those gathered in a Charlottesville park to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. \u201cI\u2019ve condemned neo-Nazis. I\u2019ve condemned many different groups,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.\u201d\n\n", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=7ae275ad012b9815306217d39bd7239b1058c2dfdfa0c6deb058d9af1bde65a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=7ae275ad012b9815306217d39bd7239b1058c2dfdfa0c6deb058d9af1bde65a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael D.
