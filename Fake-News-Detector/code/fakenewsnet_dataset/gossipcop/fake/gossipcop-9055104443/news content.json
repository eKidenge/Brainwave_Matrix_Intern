I tell myself, \u2018I\u2019m rounding first base and going to second base. It\u2019s a process.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe says he decided to do like Rocky Balboa, to try to make the team \u201cas a broken-down 40-year-old that didn\u2019t have a lot of allies.\u201d And he succeeded, finishing the season with 33 home runs. \u201cI did that at 40 and 100 percent clean, and no one can take that away from me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt told me everything about who I was.\u201d When he retired, he agreed to stay on as an adviser to Yankee owner Hal Steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players. \u201cFrom where I came from, that honor is like hitting 800,\u201d he says.\n\nThis, to Lopez, was a reveal. \u201cThe most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,\u201d she says. \u201cThe hardest times prove who you are. That\u2019s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn\u2019t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.\u201d\n\nEach believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn\u2019t have worked. \u201cWe had to grow and discover ourselves first,\u201d she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, \u201cThey weren\u2019t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.\u201d\n\nThe next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy\u2014with a sense of humor\u2014to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance.\u201d She\u2019s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, \u201cthere is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA-Rod\u2019s in the house,\u201d someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he\u2019s seen the show many times, he\u2019s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to \u201cJenny from the Block.\u201d Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez\u2019s feet. During a segment that\u2019s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. \u201cIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see what number she\u2019s wearing on her jersey,\u201d he says. It\u2019s 13, his Yankee number.\n\nHe says, \u201cWe are very much twins.\u201d She says, \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could.\u201d\n\nEarlier that day, she and Rodriguez were in Los Angeles at the premiere event for this season\u2019s Shark Tank, in which Rodriguez will be the first Latino shark. At a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says, \u201cA lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when Alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e5225b7a40d71fd1688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/673f53f5994d1fceaa4b22bb/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/logo-small-white.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6746317505a053ad7f045745/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5847108b9dee4a361369e3fe/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f36396ddf784604d17e8eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6740eeefc79e0950a8bd7343/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66339e8f5e239b9df44c911b/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6740af91b579d2bda4ee98c6/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f363955ba52f25246815cd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67462c5a020eb9e96b01eb66/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6723e19b35aac7be7f6b5dae/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6740b61ab579d2bda4ee98c8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6746042dc6914fb2e202a7e9/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639616ff751cf425ef2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/674374daba2e166bad9d4783/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/674107f7c79e0950a8bd7345/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639525b7a40d71fd1638/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6740a3983286b52bc1e440a7/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bethany Mclean", "Mario Testino", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-cover-story", "title": "J-Rod!
