News, the call was made from Disick\u2019s home, though the identity of the patient remains unclear.\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported the same, adding that the Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed that the patient, who was male, was non-violent when authorities arrived at the residence before being transported to the hospital.\n\nA 5150 hold is an involuntary psychiatric hold that occurs when a person is deemed to be a danger to either themselves or others. The patient can be held in a psychiatric hospital for up to 72 hours, unless it is extended. According to The Blast, Disick was released prior to that.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Scott Disick Is \u2018Over His Own Stupid Behavior,\u2019 Source Says\n\n\u201cScott is definitely trying to get better, but he still has bad moments,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cWhen he starts partying, he doesn\u2019t know when to stop. It\u2019s concerning to see. Everyone hopes he\u2019ll continue on a good path.\u201d\n\nSince Aug. 18, Disick has been spotted in public several times, most recently in New York City for Fashion Week, dining with Kim Kardashian at Milo\u2019s restaurant Wednesday night.\n\nEarlier this week, a source told PEOPLE that the 34-year-old is working on bettering himself after a summer of partying hard. The insider said Disick is now monitoring his drinking and has \u201cbeen feeling better.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been really good. He was just in Vegas and didn\u2019t drink,\u201d the source said. \u201cWhen he felt like he was about to slip, he would call friends who talked him off the edge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was definitely spiraling for a while,\u201d the source added. \u201cBut he got fed up with himself and was over his own stupid behavior.\u201d\n\nDisick\u2019s antics throughout the months of May and June put serious strain on his relationship with ex Kourtney Kardashian, but the pair reunited with their three children \u2014 sons Mason, 7, and Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5 \u2014 in mid-July for a low-key family getaway to Nantucket.\n\nAccording to the source, his relationship with Kourtney, 38, has been improving.\n\n\u201cHe was just tired,\u201d the source said, adding that Disick working on himself has \u201cbeen good for his relationship with Kourtney.\u201d", "images":
