She\u2019s taken off on a holiday with a couple of close friends to get away from it all. She doesn\u2019t want to run the risk of being spotted in LA, so she\u2019s trying to stay out of the spotlight as much as she can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It looks like this is the baby she\u2019s always wanted.\u2019\n\nBut sources say there\u2019s another huge reason for her wanting to lie low \u2013 problems with Brad Pitt, who friends have confirmed would be the father of her child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s believed Brad and Jen \u2013 who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen\u2019s marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year \u2013 have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad\u2019s controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.\n\nLast month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.\n\nAdded to this is the fact Jen\u2019s also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it\u2019s a difficult time for the actress.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s under a lot of stress at the moment, so\u2026 all these questions about a surprise pregnancy are the last thing she wants,\u2019 adds the source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Not only is she going through a messy divorce, she\u2019s having problems with Brad. Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she\u2019s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.\n\n\u2018Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they\u2019re just friends and that he\u2019s committed but Jen just isn\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s very wary of him \u2013 after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she\u2019s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that\u2019s how everything worked out,\u2019 reveals the insider.\n\nAfter her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.\n\n\u2018She had been sad it never happened,\u2019 a source told the magazine. \u2018But it never consumed her.\u2019\n\nBut since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This could be a dream come true for her, and she\u2019s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that\u2019s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.\u2019\n\nOver the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.\n\nIn the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: \u2018This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don\u2019t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,\u2019 she told Allure.\n\nDenying that was the case, she said: \u2018No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen\u2019s baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2023/12/Carols-Featured-image-template.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/136401/nicole-richie-kids-2.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Untitled-design-5.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/11/NIW_2441_Magshop-and-eDM-cover.jpg?resize=444%2C579", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au//wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/26857/jen-aniston-ni.jpg?resize=1024%2C683", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Copy-of-Site-Horizontal.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/New-Header-1-5.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/132096/untitled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/132172/untitled-design-2023-12-05t113134682.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Hosts-interview-Featured-image-template.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au//wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/26856/jen-pregant.jpg?resize=1024%2C681", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au//wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/26855/jen-pregnant.jpg?resize=1024%2C681", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/132452/pac-header.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/Untitled-design-81.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/09/New-Header-24.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/New-Header-9.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/12/PAC-Header.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
