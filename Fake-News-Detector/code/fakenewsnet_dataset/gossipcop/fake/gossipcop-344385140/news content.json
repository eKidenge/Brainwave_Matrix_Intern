Yep, you read that right. The whole thing got started when an Instagram comment allegedly written by Gigi's mother, Yolanda Hadid, began making the rounds on social media. The comment in question said: \"I will be a proud grandma in eight months. Life is a blessing.\"\n\nAs it turns out, it seems like that comment might have been the work of Photoshop, since the real Yolanda Hadid took to Twitter last night to clear everything up \u2014 and she made a pretty good point in the process. \"No of course not,\" Yolanda wrote in response to a fan who asked if the rumor was true. \"If my daughter was pregnant, she would be the one to announce it not me,\" she added. We want to give her a high five for that explanation because she's 100% right \u2014 in a hypothetical scenario where Gigi is pregnant, it would be her news to share, not anyone else's.\n\nNevertheless, this hasn't stopped fans from speculating on Twitter and discussing the rumor at length. But this situation is a good reminder that we shouldn't believe everything we see on the Internet, even if it seems like a legit screenshot from social media. Images can be altered, and sometimes Photoshop is very convincing. Ultimately, we need to listen to the stars themselves, and in this case, it seems like Yolanda made herself pretty clear. Perhaps we can put this particular rumor to rest now; after all, there's sure to be another one tomorrow.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6744bbab13a42690ded445c5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cba4077d013e01362e6/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-612044368.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/675984042f1809b72565f931/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/66cde071ffb380ce4eb8e1c9/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6740b29db0b9a21ccb49d525/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6755dae0dbc76c94368a06ae/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1732293121/teenvogue_character-study-tv-character-study-wicked-cast.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cdb4077d013e01362e8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6731e0e7cbe3cf51065ccef8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/670d4a26c23adcedd92ba06e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/67504ff614ffc7e10d16d674/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6744ba12a2229b8f2746f4d8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6582d5d46133bae913ebab03/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5c55b926360bd63de94360f7/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/676035fd142847d7d85f75bc/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/66e495b75f3b86c1f63138f8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/67609553a13dcee5bde934e1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/66696de6cf4c71ee4dc3076a/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cdb4077d013e01362e8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["De Elizabeth"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/yolanda-hadid-gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-pregnancy-rumors", "title": "Yolanda Hadid Addresses Gigi Hadid Pregnancy Rumors", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "De Elizabeth", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2024", "description": "Find out what Yolanda Hadid had to say about rumors that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik were having a baby.", "id": "59831845e04ba21beb2a5080", "keywords": "gigi hadid,zayn malik,rumors,yolanda hadid,twitter", "news_keywords": "gigi hadid,zayn malik,rumors,yolanda hadid,twitter", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59831845e04ba21beb2a5080", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Find out what Yolanda Hadid had to say about rumors that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik were having a baby.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cba4077d013e01362e6/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-612044368.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cba4077d013e01362e6/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-612044368.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "But there\u2019s no truth to the rumor.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cdb4077d013e01362e8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Fans Think Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Are Having a Baby", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/yolanda-hadid-gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-pregnancy-rumors"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-03T12:55:21.537Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-03T12:55:21.537Z", "author": "De Elizabeth"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "But there\u2019s no truth to the rumor.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cdb4077d013e01362e8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Fans Think Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Are Having a Baby"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831cdb4077d013e01362e8/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/facebook.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501764921.537, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
