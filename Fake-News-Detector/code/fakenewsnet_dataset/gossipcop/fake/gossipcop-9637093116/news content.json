Who cares about your lawn chairs? You can get new ones!\u201d Stefani allegedly told fans during the show.\n\n\u201cThis announcement created a stampede rush of patrons from the lawn seating area through the reserved seating area and toward the front of the performance stage, with people knocking over and breaching the security barricades and other security matter, jumping over seats in the reserved seating area, and pouring in through the aisles separating the various sections of the reserved seating area,\u201d the suit reads. Stricklin \u201cwas trampled by the rush of patrons and into a wall along the reserved seating area, causing her severe physical injuries,\u201d including a broken tibia.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nWhile Stefani never apologized for the stampede, according to the lawsuit, she did allegedly tell fans, \u201cI got in so much trouble for telling you guys to come up here!\u201d\n\nStricklin is suing Stefani for allegedly causing the stampede and Live Nation for failing to protect her. She\u2019s asking a judge to force Live Nation and Stefani to each pay her $75,000 and is seeking unspecified punitive damages from Stefani. Billboard reached out to Live Nation as was told the company could not comment on pending litigation.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/daddy-yankee-ft-lauderdale-2024-billboard-espanol-1548.jpg?w=375&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/daddy-yankee-jose-miguel-san-juan-pr-2023-billboard-pro-1260.jpg?w=375&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WIN-OR-LOSE_ONLINE-USE-D23_WoL_PubStill.pub16-H-2024.jpg?resize=225,169", "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Justin-Kuritzkes-Headshot_Matthew-DunivanJPG-2.jpeg?resize=225,169", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/megan-thee-stallion-in-her-words-2024-billboard-pro-1260.jpg?w=375&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190264965.jpg?resize=225,169", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/robert-glasper-press-credit-todd-cooper-2024-billboard-1548.jpg?w=375&h=250&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/gwen-stefani-kids-choice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=623&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/downtown-music-logo-2024-billboard-pro-1260.jpg?w=375&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/gwen-stefani-kids-choice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cover-tyler-the-creator-billboard-2024-bb19-12142024-1500.jpg?w=788", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166521044-2-e1734486017984.jpg?resize=225,169", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Gwen-Stefani-Versace-White-House-dinner-2016-billboard-oct-1548.jpg?w=237&h=147&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DSC6125-1-e1734471806792.jpeg?resize=225,169"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/gwen-stefani-kids-choice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Brooks", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/gwen-stefani-live-nation-lawsuit-concert-injury/", "title": "Fan Sues Gwen Stefani & Live Nation for Stampede That Left Her With a Broken Leg", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "A North Carolina Gwen Stefani fan is suing the No Doubt singer and concert promoter Live Nation after an accident at the PNC Music Pavilion left her with a broken leg.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.5.5", "author": "Dave Brooks", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Fan Sues Gwen Stefani & Live Nation for Stampede That Left Her With a Broken Leg", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/gwen-stefani-live-nation-lawsuit-concert-injury/", "description": "A North Carolina Gwen Stefani fan is suing the No Doubt singer and concert promoter Live Nation after an accident at the PNC Music Pavilion left her with a broken leg.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/gwen-stefani-kids-choice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Gwen Stefani arrives at the Nickelodeon's 2017 Kids' Choice Awards at USC Galen Center on March 11, 2017 in Los Angeles."}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-10T20:48:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-10T20:56:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A North Carolina Gwen Stefani fan is suing the No Doubt singer and concert promoter Live Nation after an accident at the PNC Music Pavilion left her with a broken leg.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fan Sues Gwen Stefani & Live Nation for Stampede That Left Her With a Broken Leg", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/gwen-stefani-kids-choice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499719726.0, "source": "http://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
