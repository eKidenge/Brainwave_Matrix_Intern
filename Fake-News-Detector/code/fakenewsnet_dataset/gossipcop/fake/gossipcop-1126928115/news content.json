The officers said putting dogs in fights was a decision that required \"grave discussion,\" but they knew their mission was just when Tim Rickey, the head of the Humane Society of Missouri's animal cruelty task force, gave them his support. \"For me, it was about doing the right thing,\" said Rickey.", "images": ["https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001307168/original/faux-mobster-crushes-a-mafia-family-single-handedly-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&w=500", "https://v3api.ranker.com/api/px?lid=2548171", "https://static.ranker.com/img/brand/wordmark.svg?v=1&auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=2&w=210", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_img/5655/28272231/original/brent-sprecher-u6?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&h=40&w=40", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001311150/original/cops-and-their-dogs-infiltrate-the-violent-world-of-dogfighting-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&w=500", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/voteDown.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=44&w=44", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10600724&cv=3.6&cj=1", "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1?auto=format&q=50&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&h=356.020942408377&w=680", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/menuSearch.svg?v=2&auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=30&w=30", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/vote-on-pill.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=24&w=105", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/chevronExpand.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=13&w=71", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/voteUp.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=44&w=44", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001307262/original/neo-nazi-investigation-reveals-racist-cop-photo-u2?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&w=500", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/rankedByCaret.svg?v=5&auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=8.852&w=6.898", "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/brand/6/header/logo.png?fit=fill&fm=png&q=60&dpr=2&w=75&h=56?v=17", "https://static.ranker.com/img/brand/ranker-logo.svg?v=1&auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=2&w=104"], "top_img": "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brent Sprecher"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ranker.com/list/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories/brent-sprecher", "title": "14 Insane Stories of Cops Who Went Deep Undercover For Years At A Time", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "p": {"domain_verify": "6bc9700ac759049b4fe292e21daf582a"}, "listid": 2548171, "twitter": {"site": "@ranker", "account_id": 1436986808, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "14 Insane Stories of Cops Who Went Deep Undercover For Years At A Time", "description": "Over 100 fans have voted on the 14 Insane Stories of Cops Who Went Deep Undercover For Years At A Time.
