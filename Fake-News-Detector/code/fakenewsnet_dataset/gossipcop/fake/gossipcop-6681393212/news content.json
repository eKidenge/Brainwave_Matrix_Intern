USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.\n\n\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions\u2026 They don\u2019t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,\u2019 a source spilled to the magazine.\n\n\n\nThe pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.\n\nPitt and Jolie share six children (Credit: Getty)\n\n\u2018Things are so much better among the entire family now,\u2019 continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.\n\n\n\n\u2018He\u2019s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he\u2019s come out a better person, and he\u2019s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.\u2019\n\n\n\nIn fact, the shock split may have been Angie\u2019s plan to get Brad to shape up.\n\n\n\nCourt documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the \u2018temporary judge\u2019 in their case so it remains private.\n\n\n\n\u2018Brad and Ange clearly don\u2019t want the divorce to be finalised,\u2019 pills the source.\n\n\n\n\u2018When they\u2019re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.\u2019\n\n\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.\n\n\n\n\u2018Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
