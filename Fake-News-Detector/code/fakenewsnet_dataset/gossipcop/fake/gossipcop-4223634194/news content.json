I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt. This is disrespectful, disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!!\u201d\n\nI am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this. The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me. I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt. This is disrespectful , disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!! A post shared by Voletta Wallace (@volettawallace) on Jun 29, 2017 at 9:31am PDT\n\nAccording to TMZ, Wallace\u2019s lawyer, Julian Petty, also sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Jenners.\n\nSharon Osbourne, whose husband, Ozzy Osbourne, also had his likeness featured on one of the T-shirts, took aim at the Jenner sisters as well with a scathing tweet.\n\n\u201cGirls, you haven\u2019t earned the right to put your face with musical icons,\u201d she tweeted Thursday. \u201cStick to what you know \u2026 lip gloss.\u201d\n\nGirls, you haven\u2019t earned the right to put your face with musical icons. Stick to what you know\u2026lip gloss. pic.twitter.com/BhmuUVrDBn \u2014 Sharon Osbourne (@MrsSOsbourne) June 29, 2017\n\nThe T-shirts in question were unveiled on the sisters\u2019 Kendall & Kylie online shop Wednesday, and featured images of Tupac Shakur, Biggie Smalls, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Kiss and Led Zeppelin overlaid with Instagram shots of the model/reality star siblings; they retailed for $125 and had the words \u201cRepurposed in the USA\u201d printed on each. The reality stars have since removed the products from their site.\n\nReps for Metallica, Pink Floyd, Kiss and Led Zeppelin and the Shakur estate did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Kendall and Kylie Jenner posted identical messages to Twitter apologizing for the theft. \u201cThese designs were not well thought out and we deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists. We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in anyway [sic]. The tee shirts have been pulled from retail and all images have been removed. We will use this as an opportunity to learn from these mistakes and again, we are very sorry.\u201d\n\nKylie and Kendall\u2019s misstep is only the latest in a long string of problematic marketing and business decisions plaguing the Kardashian-Jenner family.\n\nEarlier this month, Kim Kardashian came under fire for ads for her new contouring kits, which featured a decidedly darker-skinned Kardashian. Critics slammed Kim for trying to hawk her beauty products by using blackface, an accusation that Kim sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI would obviously never want to offend anyone. I used an amazing photographer and a team of people. I was really tan when we shot the images, and it might be that the contrast was off,\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cBut I showed the image to many people, to many in the business. No one brought that to our attention. No one mentioned it.\u201d\n\nKhloe Kardashian faced her own controversy earlier this month too, after fashion designer Destiney Bleu accused her of copying her bedazzled clothing designs for her new Good American collection (with email receipts to back her up). Khloe roundly denied the claims, calling Bleu\u2019s accusations \u201clittle more than a cheap publicity stunt.\u201d\n\nLess drama-prone sister Kendall caused an uproar \u2013 and an SNL skit \u2013 in April after the model starred in a TV ad for Pepsi that cheapened the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nTrending Stories What the \u2018I Slept With 100 Men in One Day\u2019 Doc Gets Right About Sex Work \u2018It\u2019s Frightening\u2019: ABC News Staffers Incensed by \u2018Capitulation\u2019 to Trump Dirty Bombs, Aliens, Holograms, and Orbs: Drone Mania Unleashes Conspiracy Theories Dems Choose 74-Year-Old Gerry Connolly Over AOC for Key Committee Role\n\n\u201cPepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize,\u201d Pepsi wrote in a statement at the time. \u201cWe did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.\u201d The commercial has been pulled off the air.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-voletta-wallace-4f072054-3c4c-422e-8735-fec826f1cbf5.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-voletta-wallace-4f072054-3c4c-422e-8735-fec826f1cbf5.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/notorious-b-i-g-s-mom-slams-kendall-kylie-jenners-disgusting-t-shirts-195635/", "title": "Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s Mom Slams Kendall, Kylie Jenner\u2019s \u2018Disgusting\u2019 T-Shirts", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Notorious B.I.G.'s mom has slammed Kylie and Kendall Jenner for using the rapper's image without permission on a T-shirt.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.5.5", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Black Sabbath, Hip-Hop, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Notorious B.I.G., Pink Floyd, The Doors, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Notorious B.I.G.'s Mom Slams Kendall, Kylie Jenner's 'Disgusting' T-Shirts", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/notorious-b-i-g-s-mom-slams-kendall-kylie-jenners-disgusting-t-shirts-195635/", "description": "Notorious B.I.G.'s mom has slammed Kylie and Kendall Jenner for using the rapper's image without permission on a T-shirt.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-voletta-wallace-4f072054-3c4c-422e-8735-fec826f1cbf5.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "kylie jenner, kylie jenner controversy, kendall jenner, kendall jenner controversy, kylie and kendall jenner t-shirts, kylie kendall jenner t-shirt controversy, kylie kendall jenner notorious b.i.g., notorious b.i.g., kardashian controversy, kardashians controversy"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-29T20:07:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:29:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Notorious B.I.G.'s mom has slammed Kylie and Kendall Jenner for using the rapper's image without permission on a T-shirt.", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s Mom Slams Kendall, Kylie Jenner\u2019s \u2018Disgusting\u2019 T-Shirts", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-voletta-wallace-4f072054-3c4c-422e-8735-fec826f1cbf5.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498766820.0, "source": "http://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
