Aliens and Twister star Bill Paxton, who died Saturday, one day before the ceremony, wasn\u2019t mentioned, though presenter Jennifer Aniston remembered the actor as she introduced Bareilles\u2019 performance.\n\nAmong those omitted from the tribute were Garry Shanding, Dan Ireland, Robert Vaughn and Doris Roberts.\n\nGARRY SHANDLING\n\nThe standup comedian died March 24, 2016, at age 66 after suffering a blood clot. Shandling is best known for his comedic turns on TV\u2019s The Larry Sanders Show and It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show and also had starring roles in Iron Man 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, What Planet Are You From? and more.\n\nDAN IRELAND\n\nThe producer and director, who died April 14, 2016, at age 57, most notably helmed 1996\u2019s The Whole Wide World and Jolene. Jessica Chastain, who made her feature debut in Jolene, tweeted her disappointment about the omission after the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment aired.\n\nROBERT VAUGHN\n\nVaughn, who died Nov. 11, 2016, at age 83, played American spy Napoleon Solo on the 1960s NBC series The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his role in The Young Philadelphians. He was also seen in The Magnificent Seven, Bullitt and Superman III.\n\nDORIS ROBERTS\n\nRoberts died of natural causes on April 17, 2016, at age 90. The actress and five-time Emmy winner is best known for starring on the series Everybody Loves Raymond and in the films Something Wild (1961), The Honeymoon Killers (1969), The Heartbreak Kid (1972), The Rose (1979) and National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation (1989).\n\nViewers also pointed out that costume and production designer Janet Patterson, who was featured in the segment, was mistakenly identified via a photo of film producer Jan Chapman, who is still alive.\n\nYep I\u2019ve double checked. That is Jan Chapman, who is very much alive. https://t.co/w7fIuiQYcr \u2014 Rhett Bartlett (@dialmformovies) February 27, 2017\n\nAn extended photo gallery that recognizes more than 200 individuals will be featured on Oscars.com.\n\nThe 89th Academy Awards, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood and aired on ABC..", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/split_vaughn_shandlign_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Annie/THR-oscars-promo.png", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/split_vaughn_shandlign_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meena Jang", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oscars-2017-memoriam-snubs-garry-shandling-robert-vaughn-980116/", "title": "Oscars \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d: Garry Shandling, Robert Vaughn Among Snubs", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Dan Ireland and Doris Roberts were also among the notable names who were left out of the ceremony's video tribute.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.5.5", "author": "Meena Jang", "tags": "Oscars, Oscars 2017", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Oscars \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d: Garry Shandling, Robert Vaughn Among Snubs", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oscars-2017-memoriam-snubs-garry-shandling-robert-vaughn-980116/", "description": "Dan Ireland and Doris Roberts were also among the notable names who were left out of the ceremony's video tribute.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/split_vaughn_shandlign_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Oscars 2017 In Memoriam Snubs Garry Shandling, Robert Vaughn"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-02-26T21:40:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-02-26T22:49:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dan Ireland and Doris Roberts were also among the notable names who were left out of the ceremony's video tribute.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oscars \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d: Garry Shandling, Robert Vaughn Among Snubs", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/split_vaughn_shandlign_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488145227.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
