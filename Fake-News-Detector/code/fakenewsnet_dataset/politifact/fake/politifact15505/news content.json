Those who continued to use the latter will have had an influence on the end results.\n\nDave Briggs, Managing Editor at PlayCanada.com, the first quarter revenue generated stands at $162 million, converting to around US$125 million. Those figures are pretty modest when compared to the more established sports betting regions such as New Jersey ($557 million), Pennsylvania ($521 million) and Michigan ($466 million).\n\nAlthough the first reports were slightly underwhelming to some, Briggs was keen to emphasise the influence of offshore operators and that it is still early days.\n\n\u201cOntario is at a quarter of comparable jurisdictions when I thought it would be half,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cThat would be a good start, a decent start.\n\n\u201cPart of that is, of course, it\u2019s the first three months. They\u2019re just getting started and not everybody is in. I didn\u2019t expect we\u2019d rival any of those (top-three jurisdictions) but we also have an established gambling industry in Ontario and we have 15 million people so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a brand new market and it\u2019s not small.\u201d\n\nOntario boasts a bigger population than Pennsylvania (13m), Michigan (10m) and New Jersey (9m), but their revenue figures were just 24%, 27% and 22% of those respective states\u2019 numbers. it should be noted, however, that the record-high Ontario Lottery numbers haven\u2019t been included in the report.\n\nThe next report will also feature the months of July, August and September, with the former two being traditionally the quietest months of the year where there is a lack of major sports such as the NFL, NBA and NHL. The return of the NFL season, especially, should have a positive impact on future numbers across the winter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get a kick, for sure,\u201d Baggs added. \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll see a definite increase in the third quarter when the NFL is in full swing and we\u2019ll also have the World Series, which is reasonably well bet.\n\n\u201cThe fourth (quarter) is that winter period where you\u2019ve got football playoffs and the Super Bowl, which is going to be the biggest one, you\u2019re going to have March Madness, you\u2019re going to have NHL and NBA playoffs.\u201d", "images": ["https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Raptors.jpeg", "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/themes/joints-wp-master/assets/images/blank.gif"], "top_img": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Raptors.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://yournewswire.com/ontario-reports-162m-revenue-from-first-three-months-of-sports-betting", "title": "Ontario Reports $162m Revenue From First Three Months Of Sports Betting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui", "description": "The launch of sports betting in Ontario, Canada came with plenty of excitement as residents would finally be able to place wagers on their favorite sports", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Ontario Reports $162m Revenue From First Three Months Of Sports Betting - yournewswire", "description": "The launch of sports betting in Ontario, Canada came with plenty of excitement as residents would finally be able to place wagers on their favorite sports", "url": "https://yournewswire.com/ontario-reports-162m-revenue-from-first-three-months-of-sports-betting", "site_name": "yournewswire", "updated_time": "2022-09-01T12:38:42+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Raptors.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Raptors.jpeg", "width": 1072, "height": 550, "alt": "Ontario", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"section": "General News", "published_time": "2022-09-01T10:10:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-01T12:38:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ontario Reports $162m Revenue From First Three Months Of Sports Betting - yournewswire", "description": "The launch of sports betting in Ontario, Canada came with plenty of excitement as residents would finally be able to place wagers on their favorite sports", "image": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Raptors.jpeg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Dustin Williams", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2024/08/cropped-cropped-ImportedPhoto.739916748.369245-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1662027026.0, "source": "https://yournewswire.com", "summary": ""}
