Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/456690441_8009574049136977_3646841607698384455_n-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/spc-12-17-24-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/nuclear-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/nightime-drone-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/GettyImages-2162806931-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/BND-POD-12-17-24-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/abundant-life-school-shooting-12-16-24-Madison-Police-Chief-Shon-Barnes-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/supreme-court-shadow-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Wisconsin-school-shooting-rev-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Brooke-Sutton_Getty-Images-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/clarissa-ward-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Robert-Reich-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/blinken-turkey-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/GettyImages-2166794993-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Lara-Trump-and-Donald-Trump-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/trudeau-stumbles-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Man-searches-night-sky-with-binoculars-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/54094793433_9ecae9a9c7_o-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Madonna-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Chipotle-workers-on-the-line-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Donald-Trump-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/Kamala-Harris-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "theme-color": "#FF5500", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rep.
