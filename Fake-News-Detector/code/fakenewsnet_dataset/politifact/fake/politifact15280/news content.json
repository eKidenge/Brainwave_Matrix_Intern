According to Sportico, the door is also open for further collaborations such as an alternate betting stream to be set up.\n\n\u201cThe NFL season is the most active time of year for our customers, so collaborating with one of the world\u2019s leading technology brands in order to offer engaging content to viewers of TNF on Prime Video is a tremendous opportunity for DraftKings,\u201d Stephanie Sherman, Chief Marketing Officer of DraftKings, said in a media release.\n\n\u201cPrime Video is an innovator in live content and we both have a similar focus on constantly improving our customers\u2019 experiences. We look forward to working with Amazon to bring millions of viewers a premium and enhanced experience during TNF on Prime Video all season long and for years to come.\u201d\n\nThe betting options available to Amazon viewers include same-game parlays on the upcoming game and pre-game odds on selected wagers. The return of football always comes with huge excitement as it starts the busiest time of the year for NFL sportsbooks across the country.\n\nThe NFL regular season, combined with the return of the NBA and MLB playoffs, makes this annually the most profitable quarter for betting sites in the U.S.\n\nDanielle Carney, head of NFL sales at Amazon Ads, added: \u201cWe are thrilled to collaborate with DraftKings to bring fans more insights and excitement as part of the TNF viewing experience.\n\n\u201cDraftKings content will contribute to lively pregame discussions, fan engagement and, perhaps, some bold predictions from our on-air talent.\u201d", "images": ["https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Chargers.jpeg", "http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/themes/joints-wp-master/assets/images/blank.gif"], "top_img": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Chargers.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://yournewswire.com/draftkings-named-exclusive-odds-provider-for-amazon-nfl-games", "title": "DraftKings Named Exclusive Odds Provider For Amazon NFL Games", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui", "description": "Amazon's Thursday Night Football broadcasts will exclusively use betting odds provided by DraftKings after the two parties agreed terms on a multi-year deal.", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "DraftKings Named Exclusive Odds Provider For Amazon NFL Games - yournewswire", "description": "Amazon's Thursday Night Football broadcasts will exclusively use betting odds provided by DraftKings after the two parties agreed terms on a multi-year deal.", "url": "https://yournewswire.com/draftkings-named-exclusive-odds-provider-for-amazon-nfl-games", "site_name": "yournewswire", "updated_time": "2022-09-14T10:41:57+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Chargers.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Chargers.jpeg", "width": 800, "height": 400, "alt": "DraftKings Named Exclusive Odds Provider For Amazon NFL Games", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"section": "General News", "published_time": "2022-09-14T10:41:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-14T10:41:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "DraftKings Named Exclusive Odds Provider For Amazon NFL Games - yournewswire", "description": "Amazon's Thursday Night Football broadcasts will exclusively use betting odds provided by DraftKings after the two parties agreed terms on a multi-year deal.", "image": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/09/Chargers.jpeg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Dustin Williams", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2024/08/cropped-cropped-ImportedPhoto.739916748.369245-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1663152112.0, "source": "http://yournewswire.com", "summary": ""}
