She gave an answer from her heart.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn her own remarks moments later, Prejean echoed Trump\u2019s statement, telling reporters: \u201cThe president of the United States, the secretary of state, and many Americans agree with me in this belief.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the final round of the Miss USA pageant, Prejean told judge Perez Hilton: \u201cI think in my country, in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised.\u201d See Also W.H. steps IMF funding\n\nW.H. lobbies for Olympics in Chicago\n\nHealth cuts mark d\u00e9tente or dodge", "images":
