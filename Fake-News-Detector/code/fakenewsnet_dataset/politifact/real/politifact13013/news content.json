Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2015, war, conflict and persecution had forced 65.3 million people globally to flee for their lives, an all-time high. The Syrian refugee crisis is the world\u2019s largest and more than 4.8 million have fled mostly to neighbouring countries whose resources are stretched thin so that increasing numbers of refugees live below national poverty lines.\n\nTo aid the most vulnerable refugees and to share the tremendous burden of these refugee-hosting countries, UNHCR has called on governments to resettle those most at risk. So far resettlement countries have pledged a total of more than 220,000 places for Syrians under resettlement and other humanitarian admissions programmes. Around 478,000 Syrians are considered to be in need of resettlement \u2013 close to 40 per cent of the 1.19 million people who are in need of resettlement globally.\n\nUNHCR recognizes that opportunities for resettlement are extremely limited and so reserves this for persons who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and persons with special medical needs. UNHCR identifies and carefully screens all refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. In the case of the United States, all refugees who are referred then undergo extensive face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, along with multiple layers of identity and security checks in a thorough process undertaken by US authorities.\n\nUNHCR calls for increased efforts to provide Syrian refugees with additional safe and regular pathways for admission. The United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on 20 September will provide opportunities for countries to show solidarity with refugee-hosting countries across the globe by giving Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups legal opportunities to access safety and protection through resettlement and other pathways for admission.\n\n\u201cResettling refugees, along with continued humanitarian funding, is a critical form of solidarity with refugee-hosting countries and it needs to be expanded worldwide,\u201d said Pitterman.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%201%201'%2F%3E", "http://www.unhcr.org/us/themes/custom/project/logo-print.png", "http://www.unhcr.org/themes/custom/project/images/logo/US-EN-UNHCR-White.svg", "https://www.unhcr.org/us/themes/custom/project/images/icons/top-icons-arrow-down.svg", "http://www.unhcr.org/us/themes/custom/project/images/logo/US-EN-UNHCR-Blue.svg", "http://www.unhcr.org/themes/custom/project/images/icons/close.svg", "https://www.unhcr.org/us/themes/custom/project/share-image.png"], "top_img": "https://www.unhcr.org/us/themes/custom/project/share-image.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.unhcr.org/news/news-releases/un-refugee-agency-welcomes-arrival-10000th-syrian-refugee-resettled-united", "title": "UN Refugee Agency welcomes arrival of 10,000th Syrian refugee resettled to United States", "meta_data": {"description": "UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has welcomed news of the arrival in the United States this week of the 10,000th refugee from the conflict in Syria, and calls for greater global solidarity ahead of summits next month that will look at ways to increase efforts to deal with the unprecedented refugee crisis worldwide.", "referrer": "origin", "rights": "\u00a92024 UNHCR US.
