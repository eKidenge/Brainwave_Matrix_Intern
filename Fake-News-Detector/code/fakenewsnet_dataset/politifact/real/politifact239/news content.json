This table breaks out Department budget totals by discretionary and mandatory spending. Spending for discretionary programs is decided in the annual appropriations process. In contrast, spending for mandatory programs is usually a function of the authorizing statutes creating the programs, and generally is not affected by appropriations laws. To learn more about discretionary and mandatory spending in the Education Department, please see Budget Process and Calendar . Please note: the FY 2006 and FY 2007 appropriations shown on this table include the one-time emergency supplemental funds appropriated for recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\n\n\nState Funding History Tables: FY 1980 -- FY 2024\n\n\n\nThese historical tables show State funding under formula-allocated and selected student aid programs administered by the Department.
