At its heart, the site is designed to answer a simple question: Who paid for the 1996 elections?\n\n\n\nTo help you answer that question, you can look up a detailed financial profile of your own Senators and representatives in Congress, showing exactly which industries and interest groups contributed to their 1996 campaigns, and even which states and metro areas were their richest sources of campaign cash.\n\n\n\nIn the weeks and months ahead, we'll be expanding the information on these pages to include state profiles, industry and interest group profiles, Congressional committee profiles, and eventually vote correlations.\n\n\n\nWe'll also be expanding the interactivity of the site, making it possible for you to ask your own questions - how much did the tobacco industry give in the last election, for example, or where does your congressman rank in dollars from labor unions, defense contractors, or phone companies.\n\n\n\nIf you want even more detailed information on the subject of money and politics, you can click at any time to the Center's home page - www.crp.org.\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/19980110220043im_/http://www.crp.org/img/crp_SMALL.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/19980110220043im_/http://www.crp.org/img/crp_SMALL.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Welcome to Open Secrets Interactive", "meta_data": {}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
